# Docs scripts

## Autogenerating Hooks Docs

The hooks reference page is **autogenerated**.

```bash
bazel build //docs/site:site
```

This is generated during the Bazel docs build and does **not** need to be committed.

### CI auto-check (recommended)

In CI, `hooks.mdx` is generated as part of the Bazel docs build (`//docs/site:site`), so it does **not**
need to be committed.
