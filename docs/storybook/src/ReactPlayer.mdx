# React Player

This shows the most basic way of rendering Player in a React app.

Create a React Player using the `useReactPlayer` hook, pass it a flow to render, and use the `ReactPlayer.Component` to render the component in your app:

```tsx
const App = () => {
  const { reactPlayer } = useReactPlayer({
    plugins: [new ReferenceAssetsPlugin()],
  });

  React.useEffect(() => {
    reactPlayer.start(/** Add content here */);
  }, []);

  return <reactPlayer.Component />;
};
```

<Story of={PlayerStory.ReactPlayer} />

# Managed React Player

The Managed Player is a way of orchestrating chained flows through a React Player.
It will step through each flow in the sequence, and enable users to respond after each one.

Between loading each flow, the `ManagedPlayer` will trigger `React.Suspense` and wait for the next flow to be returned.

## Error Handling

Within Player there are 2 ways of triggering an error, either sent from the UI (custom assets) or from the core Player library (invalid expressions, etc).
In either scenario, the `ManagedPlayer` will trigger a `fallbackComponent` that can be used to render an error screen. The `fallbackComponent` gets props for either _restarting_ the current flow, which will retry the last flow that Player ran, or _resetting_ the current series of flows (starting over from the very begining)

### Content Errors

This is an example of a flow that triggers an error with an issue within the content itself -- in this case trying to evaluate an invalid expression.

### Asset Errors

This is an example of a flow that triggers an error from the UI -- in this case trying to render as asset type that has no registered handler.
