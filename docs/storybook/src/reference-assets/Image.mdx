## Image with Caption

You can include a caption which appears underneath the image. This must be a text asset.

## Image with alt text

You can also provide a placeholder string and/or an accessibility string. The alt text for the image will be the accessibility string. If not provided, it will be the placeholder string. If that is also not provided, it will be the caption text.
