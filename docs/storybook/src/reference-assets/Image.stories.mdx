# Image Asset

The Image asset allows you to render an image from a reference.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Basic">
    <StoryWrapper>
      <PlayerStory flow={imageFlow} />
    </StoryWrapper>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Image with Caption

You can include a caption which appears underneath the image. This must be a text asset.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Caption">
    <StoryWrapper>
      <PlayerStory flow={imageCaptionFlow} />
    </StoryWrapper>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Image with alt text 

You can also provide a placeholder string and/or an accessibility string. The alt text for the image will be the accessibility string. If not provided, it will be the placeholder string. If that is also not provided, it will be the caption text.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Accessibility">
    <StoryWrapper>
      <PlayerStory flow={imageAccessibilityFlow} />
    </StoryWrapper>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Placeholder">
    <StoryWrapper>
      <PlayerStory flow={imagePlaceholderFlow} />
    </StoryWrapper>
  </Story>
</Canvas>
