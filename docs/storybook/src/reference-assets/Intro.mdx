# Reference Assets

The assets in this section serve as an example and base for building out a plugin to provide a full fledged asset support for an application.

## Usage

To import and use these assets in your app, simply import the plugin and attach it to Player:

```tsx
import { useReactPlayer, ReactPlayerPlugin } from "@player-ui/react";
import ReferenceAssetsPlugin from "@player-ui/reference-assets-plugin-react";

const plugins: Array<ReactPlayerPlugin> = [new ReferenceAssetsPlugin()];

export const App = () => {
  // Create Player with our plugins
  const { reactPlayer } = useReactPlayer({ plugins });

  // Start the flow.

  React.useEffect(() => {
    reactPlayer.start(/** Insert your player content */);
  }, []);

  // Render Player
  return <reactPlayer.Component />;
};
```
