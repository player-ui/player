import { PackageManagers } from 'starlight-package-managers'

## SDK Initialization

To start using the XLR SDK you'll need to install the SDK package

<PackageManagers pkg="@player-tools/xlr-sdk" />

Next, import the SDK 

```typescript
import { XLRSDK } from "@player-tools/xlr-sdk"
```

_If you want to implement a custom object store, also import the `XLRRegistry` interface and have your custom registry implement it._

Lastly, just initialize an instance of it. 

```typescript
import { XLRSDK } from "@player-tools/xlr-sdk"

const sdk = new XLRSDK();
```

or if you want to use your custom registry, just pass it in to the initializer. 

```typescript
import { XLRSDK } from "@player-tools/xlr-sdk"
import { customRegistry } from "./customRegistry"

const sdk = new XLRSDK(customRegistry);
```

## Loading Types into the SDK

If you want to load XLR types from disk, you can use the `loadDefinitionsFromDisk` function and pass it the path to parent folder of the `xlr` directory.

```typescript
const sdk = new XLRSDK();
sdk.loadDefinitionsFromDisk('./common/static_xlrs/core');
```

If you want to load XLR types from a module, you can use the `loadDefinitionsFromModule` function and pass it the module to load from.

```typescript
const sdk = new XLRSDK();
sdk.loadDefinitionsFromModule(require("@player-ui/reference-assets-plugin").path);
```

- If you want to filter any of the types that are being loaded, you can supply a `Filters` object as the *second* arguments
- If you want to apply any transform functions to the modules that you load, you can supply a list of `TransformFunction` as the *third* argument

## Usage

After the types are loaded into the SDK there are a couple ways to interact with them.

### Type Recall

To get a type back you can use the `getType` function and pass the name of the type you want to retrieve. You can also use the `hasType` function to check to see if the type exists before you try and access it. 

```typescript
const sdk = new XLRSDK();
if(sdk.hasType("InputAsset")){
  return sdk.getType("InputAsset")
} else {
  throw new Error("Oh no!")
}
```

### Type Validation

To validate if some JSON content matches the expected type, you can use the `validateType` function. You will need to supply a `Node` from the `jsonc-parser` library. 

```typescript
import { parseTree } from 'jsonc-parser';
import { XLRSDK } from '@player-tools/xlr-sdk'

const sdk = new XLRSDK();

///... Loading XLRs

const mockAsset = parseTree(`
    {
      "id": 1,
      "type": "input",
      "binding": "some.data",
      "label": {
        "asset": {
          "value": "{{input.label}}"
        }
      }
    `);

return sdk.validate('InputAsset', mockAsset)
```
