title: Exporting XLRs
---

import { PackageManagers } from 'starlight-package-managers'

XLR creation is done through the Player CLI which can be added to your project like so:

<PackageManagers pkg="@player-tools/cli" />


## Exporting Base Type Definitions

If you want to compile all exported interfaces/types and are using our Bazel rules, you will want to use the `js_xlr_pipeline` macro and set the `xlr_mode` option to `"types"`. 

```starlark
js_xlr_pipeline(
    package_name = "<package name>",
    xlr_mode = "types",
)
```

If you are not using our Bazel rules, run the Player CLI as part of your build

```bash
player xlr compile -m types <other options>
```

## Exporting Plugin Capabilities

If you are writing a Player Plugin, you'll first need to have your plugin extend the `ExtendedPlayerPlugin` interface and fill in the generics with an array of the interfaces/types for each Capability. In order, the generics denote:

- Assets
- Views
- Expressions
- Data Types

For example, you can see how its done below in the [core reference assets plugin](https://github.com/player-ui/player/blob/main/plugins/reference-assets/core/src/plugin.ts)

```typescript
export class ReferenceAssetsPlugin
  implements
    PlayerPlugin,
    ExtendedPlayerPlugin<
      [InputAsset, TextAsset, ActionAsset, InfoAsset, CollectionAsset]
    >
```

### Bazel

If you are using our Bazel rules, you will want to use the same `js_xlr_pipeline` macro. The default mode is `"plugin"` so the `xlr_mode` option can be omitted or explicitly set if desired.

```starlark
js_xlr_pipeline(
    package_name = "<package name>",
    build_deps = [...],
    peer_deps = [...],
    test_deps = [...],
    deps = [...],
    xlr_mode = "plugin"
)
```

### Non-Bazel
Otherwise, if you are not using Bazel then run the following command as part of your build

```shell
player xlr compile -m plugin <other options>
```
