## Who We Are

The Player Team is comprised of a group of engineers at Intuit who are passionate about dynamic experiences. Our multidisciplinary background and our multi-platform experience has allowed our team to create and support the Player framework internally for the past few years. You may have seen some of the other open-source projects from out team including [auto](https://github.com/intuit/auto), [design-systems-cli](https://github.com/intuit/design-systems-cli), [hooks](https://github.com/intuit/hooks), [proof](https://github.com/intuit/proof), and more. We are excited to share our work with the open source community and see how Player grows in the years to come.
