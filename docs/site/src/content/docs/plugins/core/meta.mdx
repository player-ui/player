The Meta Plugin is an easy way to combine multiple _other_ plugins into 1 group. It is often used when sharing a set of plugins across platforms (each platform registering 1 common set of _core_ plugins).

## Usage

<PlatformTabs>
  <Fragment slot='core'>

Create a grouping of other plugins:

```js
import { MetaPlugin } from "@player-ui/meta-plugin";

const pluginGroup = new MetaPlugin([new Plugin1(), new Plugin2()]);
```

Add the plugin to Player:

```js
import { Player } from "@player-ui/player";

const player = new Player({
  plugins: [pluginGroup],
});
```

You can share `pluginGroup` with others as an easy way to group multiple plugin features together.

  </Fragment>
</PlatformTabs>
