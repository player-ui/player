title: Data Change Listener
---

import PlatformTabs from "../../../../components/PlatformTabs.astro";

This plugin enables users to subscribe to data-change events within a view, and run expressions when the target value changes. Expressions are added to a listeners property of the view, with events prefixed by `dataChange` and the target binding:

```json
{
  "id": "example-view",
  "type": "info",
  "listeners": {
    "dataChange.foo.bar": "helloWorld()",
    "dataChange.foo.baz": ["helloWorld()", "doSomethingElseToo()"]
  }
}
```

## Installation

<PlatformTabs>
  <Fragment slot='core'>

Add it to Player:

```js
import { Player } from "@player-ui/player";
import { DataChangePlugin } from "@player-ui/data-change-plugin";

const player = new Player({
  plugins: [new DataChangePlugin()],
});
```

  </Fragment>
</PlatformTabs>

## Usage

The format of `dataChange.<binding>` will execute the _value_ (any valid expression or collection of expressions), anytime a value within the target binding's tree is updated (`foo.bar` and `foo.baz` in the example above).

Registrations can be made for any partial binding path, and will be evaluated anytime that path, or any child path, is mutated. The above example registration of `dataChange.foo.bar` will be triggered by a change to `foo.bar`, `foo.bar.baz`, or any other child path. (it will not be triggered by a change to `foo.baz`).

The subscriptions are tied to the lifecycle of the _view_ they're defined in. They will _not_ be called upon initial render of the view, and will expire when the view is no longer the active state (when transitioning to a new state in the flow).

## Wildcard Placeholders

To subscribe to a binding including a dynamic segment (array index, etc). Use a placeholder value of `_` in the binding.

```json
{
  "listeners": {
    "dataChange.foo._.bar": "helloWorld(_index_)"
  }
}
```

Similar to _template_ processing, any `_index_` reference in the expression will be replaced by the dynamic value. In the example above, a change from `foo.3.bar` will result in the `helloWorld()` expression being evaluated.

Sub-paths that don't match the changed binding will not trigger the expression. Using the same example, a change from `foo.4.baz` will _not_ trigger the expression since `bar` does not match with `baz`.
