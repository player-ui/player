## What are _transforms_?

Transforms are functions that map the authored JSON representation of an asset into a stateful JavaScript object, including all of the properties required for that asset to interact with the data-model, navigation, and the rest of Player. This allows UI implementations to have consistent treatment and behavior. While the transform plugin is registered in the _core_ layer, it can be wrapped by the native platforms.

## Partial Matching

The transform plugin makes use of the `partial-match-registry` which ranks matching templates by the number of matching key-value pairs. This allows users to overwrite the implementation of the lookup, if more specific search criteria is provided. This registry/lookup pattern is also utilized in the web-player for the React Component to Asset mapping.

## Usage

<PlatformTabs>
  <Fragment slot='core'>

## Transform Arguments

Each `transform` is a function that is passed 3 arguments: the current `asset` node, and an _options_ object containing a data-model, expression-evaluator, binding-parser, and a flow transition function, and a store for state management. The transforms should return an immutable representation of the asset, including any means of interacting with the _player_.

```javascript
import { Player } from "@player-ui/player";
import { AssetTransformPlugin } from "@player-ui/asset-transform-plugin";

// Add it to Player

const player = new Player({
  plugins: [
    new AssetTransformPlugin(
      new Registry([
        // Register a match for any _action_ type with a custom transform.
        [
          { type: "action" },
          (value) => {
            return {
              ...value,
              hello: () => console.log("hello world"),
            };
          },
        ],
      ]),
    ),
  ],
});
```

### State Management

Often times node transforms require some state to be stored between updates. Historically this state was put in the data-model under `local` (to not send it back to the server), but updates became difficult to manage, and namespace collisions under _local_ were up to the transforms to discern.

The third argument to the transform functions expose a store for data, that mirrors the usage of `React` hooks. This allow transforms to store state information in an automatically scoped store outside of the normal data tree.

A simple transform to manage a counter might look like:

```javascript
const transform = (asset, options, store) => {
  const [count, setCount] = store.useState(0);
  return {
    ...asset,
    count,
    increment() {
      setCount(count + 1);
    },
  };
};
```

  </Fragment>

## Example

<PlatformTabs>
  <Fragment slot='core'>

If the authored JSON is:

```json
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "asset": {
        "id": "foo",
        "type": "action"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

the transform-plugin would run the transform on the `action` asset, attaching a new `hello()` method. This can be invoked by any consumer of the current _view_, as a means of interacting with the _player_.

```javascript
{
  actions: [
    {
      asset: {
        id: "foo",
        type: "action",
        hello: () => console.log("hello world"),
      },
    },
  ];
}
```

  </Fragment>
</PlatformTabs>
