import PlatformTabs from "../../../../components/PlatformTabs.astro";

The `data-filter-plugin` enables users to filter out segments of the data-model during serialization.

## Usage

<PlatformTabs>
  <Fragment slot='core'>

Add the plugin to Player and configure the exclusion paths:

```ts
import { Player } from "@player-ui/player";
import { DataFilterPlugin } from "@player-ui/data-filter-plugin";

const player = new Player({
  plugins: [
    new DataFilterPlugin({
      paths: ["local", "constants"],
    }),
  ],
});
```

This will exclude any top-level `local` or `constants` paths in the data-model from appearing in the serialized response.

  </Fragment>
</PlatformTabs>
