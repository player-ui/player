The Metrics Plugin is used to gather timing information about Player's execution of a flow. There are also platform specific integrations to include `render` and `update` times.

The diagram below illistrates some of the timing information gathered:

## Usage

<PlatformTabs>
  <Fragment slot='core'>

Add the plugin to Player:

```js
import { Player } from "@player-ui/player";
import { MetricsPlugin } from "@player-ui/metrics-plugin";

const player = new Player({
  plugins: [
    new MetricsPlugin({
      onUpdate: (metrics) => {
        // Handle the update
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

The `onUpdate` callback will be invoked for any update to the metrics. There are also callbacks for finer-grained events (`onRenderEnd`, `onInteractive`, etc), as well as a `hooks` based API for even more control.

## Using a custom timer

By default, all time is measured in ms using `performance.now()` with a fallback to the less-accurate `Date.now()`.
If you wish to supply your own timer, simply use the `getTime` option to set the function to use.

## Measuring Render Time

For extensions of this plugin that wish to track the render (and update) times of nodes, add the `trackRenderTime` flag to `options`. You must then call `metrics.renderEnd()` to denote when content is painted on the screen. This is automatically handled for the platform specific versions of this plugin.

  <Fragment slot='react'>

The `react` version of the Metrics Plugin adds support for `render` and `update` times to events. The API mirrors that of the core version:

```js
import { ReactPlayer } from "@player-ui/react";
import { MetricsPlugin } from "@player-ui/metrics-plugin-react";

const player = new ReactPlayer({
  plugins: [
    new MetricsPlugin({
      onUpdate: (metrics) => {
        // Handle the update
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot='ios'>

The `ios` version of the Metrics Plugin will track initial render time for each view in a flow. Due to current SwiftUI limitations, update time can't be tracked yet. It can be used in conjunction with a core plugin that utilizes the events, through `findPlugin`, or standalone.

### CocoaPods

Add the subspec to your `Podfile`

```ruby
pod 'PlayerUI/MetricsPlugin'
```

### Swift Usage

```swift
var body: some View {
  SwiftUIPlayer(
    flow: flow,
    plugins: [
      // Tracking render time can be controlled with a parameter
      MetricsPlugin(trackRenderTime: true) { timing, nodeMetrics, flowMetrics in
        // Handle metrics payload
        log(timing.duration ?? -1)
      }
    ],
    result: $resultBinding
  )
}
```

  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot='android'>

The `JVM` Metrics plugin can track render time for views in a flow.

In build.gradle

```kotlin
implementation "com.intuit.playerui.plugins:metrics:$PLAYER_VERSION"
```

In Player constructor

```kotlin
import com.intuit.playerui.plugins.expression.ExpressionPlugin

val metricsPlugin = MetricsPlugin { timing, renderMetrics, flowMetrics ->
  ...
}
AndroidPlayer(metricsPlugin)
```

  </Fragment>
</PlatformTabs>

## Beaconing

<PlatformTabs>
  <Fragment slot='core'>

The Metrics Plugin also includes a plugin for the Beacon Plugin that adds render time to the hook context for `viewed` beacons send for views. This plugin is automatically registered to the Beacon Plugin if the `trackRenderTime` option is enabled.

In order to _actually_ include the render-time in a beacon, you must create a `BeaconPluginPlugin` that maps the renderTime from the hook's context to the actual beacon object. It can be accessed through the `MetricsViewBeaconPluginContextSymbol` key:

```ts
import { MetricsViewBeaconPluginContextSymbol } from '@player-ui/metrics-plugin';
import { BeaconPluginPlugin } from '@player-ui/beacon-plugin';

class MyBeaconPluginPlugin implements BeaconPluginPlugin {
  apply(beaconPlugin: BeaconPlugin) {
    beaconPlugin.hooks.buildBeacon.tap(
      { name: 'my-beacon-plugin', context: true } as Tap,
      async (context, beacon) => {
        const { renderTime } =
          (await (context as any)[MetricsViewBeaconPluginContextSymbol]) || {};

        return {
          ...beacon,
          ...(renderTime && { renderTime }),
        };
      }
    );
  }
```

See the [Beacon Plugin](/plugins/multiplatform/beacon) for more info.
