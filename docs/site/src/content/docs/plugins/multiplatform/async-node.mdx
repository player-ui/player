The AsyncNode Plugin is used to enable streaming additional content into a flow that has already been loaded and rendered.  
A common use case for this plugin is conversational UI, as the users input more dialogue, new content must be streamed into Player in order to keep the UI up to date.

The pillar that makes this possible is the concept of an `AsyncNode`. An `AsyncNode` is any tree node with the property `async: true`, it represents a placeholder node that will be replaced by a concrete node in the future. `AsyncNode` is added to the AST tree during asset transform process(You can read more about what transform is [here](/assets/transforms)). In the example below, it shows the content and resolved result. 

#### Content authoring:

Value of `chat-message` is the asset to render
- JSON content
```json
      {
        "id": "chat-1",
        "type": "chat-message",
        "value": {
          "id": "text-1",
          "type": "text",
          "value": "chat message",
        },
      },
```
- DSL
```typescript
  <ChatMessage id="chat">
    <ChatMessage.Value>
      <Text>Hello World!</Text>
    </ChatMessage.Value>
  </ChatMessage>
```

#### Resolved

`chat-message` asset is wrapped into a wrapper container with children including the `Text` asset in value and an `AsyncNode` in the associated asset transform before resolving. 
```json
    {
      "id": "collection-async-chat-1",
      "type": "collection",
      "values": [
        {
          "asset": {
            "id": "1",
            "type": "text",
            "value": "chat message",
          },
        },
      ],
    }
```
If there is no asset to display, there will be only one `AsyncNode` in resolved result and no content will be rendered.
```json
      {
        "id": "chat-1",
        "type": "chat-message",
      },
```


The `AsyncNodePlugin` exposes an `onAsyncNode` hook on all platforms. The `onAsyncNode` hook will be invoked with the current node when the plugin is available and an `AsyncNode` is detected during the resolve process. The node used to call the hook with could contain metadata according to content spec.

User should tap into the `onAsyncNode` hook to examine the node's metadata before making a decision on what to replace the async node with. The return could be a single asset node or an array of asset nodes, or the return could be even a null|undefined if the async node is no longer relevant.

Returning a value in the above context enables uses cases where the async node only needs to be resolved once. For use cases where the async node needs to be updated multiple times, the onAsyncNode hook provides a second callback argument that can be used to update the value multiple times. For example, if the async node is used to represent some placeholder for toasts, or notifications, the async node handler could initially resolve with some content, and then update with null after some time to remove those views.

### Continuous Streaming

In order to keep streaming in new content, there must be at least 1 or more `AsyncNode`s in the view tree at all times.  
This means there must be a constant renewal of new `AsyncNode`s after the previous ones are resolved by the user.

## Usage

The `AsyncNodePlugin` itself accepts an options object with a `plugins` array, enabling the integration of multiple view plugins for extended functionality.
The `AsyncNodePluginPlugin` is provided as a default way of handling asset-async nodes, it is just one handler for one possible way of using async nodes. If the default behavior does not align with the desired usage, users are able to provide their own implementation of the handler in the form of a plugin to be passed to the base `AsyncNodePlugin`. The `AsyncNodePluginPlugin` also comes from the `'@player-ui/async-node-plugin'` and contains the resolver and parser functionality.

Add the plugin to Player:

```typescript
import { Player } from '@player-ui/player';
import { AsyncNodePlugin, AsyncNodePluginPlugin } from '@player-ui/async-node-plugin';

const asyncNodePlugin = new AsyncNodePlugin({
    plugins: [new AsyncNodePluginPlugin()],
});

// Configuring async node behaviour
asyncNodePlugin.hooks.onAsyncNode.tap('handleAsync', async (node: Node.Node) => {
  ...
  // Determine what to return to be parsed into a concrete UI asset
});

// For use cases where the async node needs to be updated multiple times

asyncNodePlugin.hooks.onAsyncNode.tap("toast-provider", async (node: Node.Async, update: (content) => void) => {
    ...
  // do some async task to get content
  const toastContent = await makeToastFor(node.id);
  // set timer for 5 seconds to remove the toast content from the view
  setTimeout(() => update(null), 5000);
  // uses same mechanism as before
  return toastContent;
});

const player = new Player({
  plugins: [
    asyncNodePlugin
  ]
})
```

or initialize plugin with async handler

```typescript
import { Player } from '@player-ui/player';
import { AsyncNodePlugin, AsyncNodePluginPlugin } from '@player-ui/async-node-plugin';

const asyncHandler = (
  node: Node.Async,
  callback: (content: any) => void,
) => {
  // do some async task to get content
  return result;
};

const plugin = new AsyncNodePlugin(
  {
    plugins: [new AsyncNodePluginPlugin()],
  },
  asyncHandler,
);

const player = new Player({
  plugins: [
    asyncNodePlugin
  ]
})
```

The `react` version of the AsyncNodePlugin is identical to using the core plugin. Refer to core usage for handler configuration:

```typescript
import { ReactPlayer } from "@player-ui/react";
import {
  AsyncNodePlugin,
  AsyncNodePluginPlugin,
} from "@player-ui/async-node-plugin";

const asyncNodePlugin = new AsyncNodePlugin({
  plugins: [new AsyncNodePluginPlugin()],
});

const player = new ReactPlayer({
  plugins: [asyncNodePlugin],
});
```

### Error Handling

By default, errors happening during the `onAsyncNode` hook bubble up as player flow failures. These errors can come from the taps themselves, or from parsing the result of those taps within the core plugin. Use the `onAsyncNodeError` to catch these errors and handle them gracefully. Even if the error is handled, it will be logged by the player logger. The return on the hook will determine what gets rendered in the view. To render nothing, return `null`

```typescript
const asyncNodePlugin = new AsyncNodePlugin({
  plugins: [new AsyncNodePluginPlugin()],
});

asyncNodePlugin.hooks.onAsyncNodeError.tap("handleAsyncError", (error, node) => {
  // Do something to handle the error in the background

  return null;
});
```

### Swift Usage

In integration code

```swift
var body: some View {
    SwiftUIPlayer(
        flow: flow,
        plugins: [
          AsyncNodePlugin(plugins: [AsyncNodePluginPlugin()]), asyncHookHandler: { node in
              // Determine what to return either using the singleNode or multiNode case
              // Then JSON can be provided using the concrete case, see below for using the encodable case
              return .singleNode(.concrete(jsContext?.evaluateScript("""
                  ({"asset": {"id": "text", "type": "text", "value":"new node from the hook"}})
                  """) ?? JSValue()))

              // OR
              return .multiNode([
                .concrete(jsContext?.evaluateScript("""
                  ({"asset": {"id": "text", "type": "text", "value":"1st value in the multinode"}})
                  """) ?? JSValue()),
                .concrete(jsContext?.evaluateScript("""
                  ({"asset": {"id": "async-node-2", "async": "true" }})
                  """) ?? JSValue())
              ])

          }
        ],
        result: $resultBinding
    )
}
```
or tapping asycHandler after initializing the plugin

```swift
var body: some View {
    let asyncHandler: AsyncHookHandler = { _,_ in
        return .singleNode(.concrete(JSValue()))
    }

    let plugin = AsyncNodePlugin(plugins: [asyncNodePluginPlugin])

    plugin.context = context

    plugin.hooks?.onAsyncNode.tap({ node, callback in
        let replacementNode = try await (asyncHandler)(node, callback)
        return replacementNode.handlerTypeToJSValue(context: context ?? JSContext()) ?? JSValue()
    })
    
    SwiftUIPlayer(
        flow: flow,
        plugins: [plugin],
        result: $resultBinding
    )
}
```

The plugin also provides a default asset placeholder struct that is encodable, instead of passing in the JSON string users can use
`AssetPlaceholderNode` which includes an `asset` key that takes any user defined Encodable struct as the value. Assuming the following encodable struct is defined:

```swift
struct PlaceholderNode: Codable, Equatable, AssetData {
    public var id: String
    public var type: String
    var value: String?

    public init(id: String, type: String, value: String? = nil) {
        self.id = id
        self.type = type
        self.value = value
    }
}
```

Instead of using the JSON string above, the following can be used:

```swift
return .singleNode(.encodable(PlaceholderNode(id: "text", type: "text", value: "new node from the hook")))

// OR

return .multiNode([
    ReplacementNode.encodable(PlaceholderNode(id: "text", type: "text", value: "1st value in the multinode")),
    ReplacementNode.encodable(AsyncNode(id: "id"))])
```

Note: the AsyncNode struct is already defined in the plugin with the `async` property defaulted to true so only `id` needs to be passed in

As a convenience to the user, the AsyncNodePlugin just takes a callback which has the content to be returned, this is provided to the plugin which calls the the `onAsyncNode` hook tap method. The return could be a single asset node or an array of asset nodes, or null if the async node is no longer relevant.

### AsyncTransform
`createAsyncTransform` is a helper function to create the transform for async asset. The function takes a set of options that help adjust the transform generated to your needs:
- flatten (Optional. Default: true) - Whether or not to flatten chained results of the same asset type into a single container.
- path (Optional. Default: ["values"]) - The path to the array within the `wrapperAssetType` that will contain the async content.
- transformAssetType (Required) - The asset type that the transform is matching against.
- wrapperAssetType (Required) - The asset type that will contain the async content.
- getNestedAsset (Optional) - Function to get any nested asset that will need to be extracted and kept when creating the wrapper asset. This is useful when combined with `flatten: true` to help chain async content with a single asset type.
- getAsyncNodeId (Optional) - Function to get the id for the generated async node. By default it uses a format of `async-{asset.id}`
- asyncNodePosition (Optional) - Where to place the async node relative to the asset from `getNestedAsset`. Defaults to `"append"`

#### Usage

Setting up a transform like below:

```ts
const beforeResolve = createAsyncTransform({
  transformAssetType: "chat-message",
  wrapperAssetType: "collection",
  getNestedAsset: (node) => node.children?.[0]?.value
})
```

transforms the following content:

```json
{
  "id": "chat",
  "type": "chat-message",
  "value": {
    "id": "text",
    "type": "text",
    "value": "chat message",
  },
},
```

into: 

```json
{
  "id": "collection-async-chat",
  "type": "collection",
  "values": [
    {
      "id": "text",
      "type": "text",
      "value": "chat message",
    },
    { /** async content managed by your handler */ }
  ],
},
```

And using additional `chat-message` assets in the async content will flatten itself into this top level collection.

### Flatten
Flatten is introduced to avoid nested structure caused by continuous streaming. eg. When a new `chat-message` asset is streamed in, in AST tree, instead of `[chat1, [chat2, asyncNode]]`, it's flattened into `[chat1, chat2, asyncNode]`
