import { PackageManagers } from "starlight-package-managers";

Generate diagnostics for content complexity using `@player-tools/complexity-check-plugin`.

## Install

<PackageManagers pkg="@player-tools/complexity-check-plugin" />

## Usage

```js
const COMPLEXITY_WARNING_THRESHOLD = 1000;

export default {
  plugins: [
    new ComplexityCheck({
      maxAcceptableComplexity: 20000,
      maxWarningLevel: COMPLEXITY_WARNING_THRESHOLD,
      // optional: weights per asset type
      typeWeights: { text: 8, image: 7.5 },
    }),
  ],
};
```

This produces diagnostics like `Content complexity is 640` which can be consumed by the [Metrics Output Plugin](/docs/capabilities/metrics-output).

```js
complexity: extractFromDiagnostics(/Content complexity is (\d+)/, Number);
```
