## iOS Development Issues

### 1. iOS Builds Fail

#### **Symptoms**
The iOS build fails due to a `tsup` error even though the core files definitely exist. You may see an error like this:
```
/Users/---/dev/GitHub/player/core/types/BUILD:11:16: tsup core/types/dist/index.mjs failed: (Exit 1): types_tsup_build_tsup_bin failed: error executing tsup command (from target //core/types:types_tsup_build)
```

#### **Solution / Workaround**
The most likely cause is a rare cache corruption.
1. Go to `.bazelrc` and comment out the ‚ÄúCache Config for Build‚Äù block.
1. Run the command you were trying again. Wait for it to succeed.
1. Uncomment the cache block.
1. Run the command again. It should work properly now.


### 2. ViewInspector Test Crashes

**Symptoms:**
- New ViewInspector tests crash when running
- Test failures with threading-related errors

**Solution:**
ViewInspector requires the tests to be running on the main thread in a few different cases. To fix this, add `@MainActor` to the test class:

```swift
@MainActor
class MyPluginViewInspectorTests: XCTestCase {
    // Your ViewInspector tests here
}
```

### 3. Swift Compiler Metadata Errors

**Symptoms:**
```
Unable to parse compiler-emitted metadata at `file:///path/to/Wrappers.swiftconstvalues`: The file "Wrappers.swiftconstvalues" couldn't be opened because there is no such file.
```

**Solution:**
This occurs when Xcode tries to compile Swift files directly instead of using Bazel's pre-built outputs.

1. **Regenerate the Xcode project:**
   ```bash
   bazel clean
   bazel run //ios:xcodeproj
   ```

2. **Use the correct scheme:** Ensure you're using the "PlayerUIDemo" scheme in Xcode (not individual library schemes)

3. **Clean Xcode build folder:** In Xcode, go to Product ‚Üí Clean Build Folder
