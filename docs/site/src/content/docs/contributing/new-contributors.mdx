# Welcome, New Contributors!

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Player! This guide will help you get started with your first contribution.

## Getting Started

<Steps>

1. **Fork the Repository**
   
   The git workflow for forking is slightly different than the normal branch workflow. Rather than cloning the main repo and pushing a new branch, each person works off of their own fork and pushes their own branches there. This helps limit the need (especially for non-team members) to give out access rights to the repo to push up a branch, and also helps keep the main repo clean from stale branches.

   The easiest way to maintain your own fork is via the GitHub CLI, which you can easily install through Homebrew. After you've gone through the initial setup, the CLI gives us a few powerful commands that do most of the legwork for us when working with a fork.

2. **Clone and Set Up Fork**
   
   Start by cloning the repo you'd like to contribute to:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/player-ui/player.git
   cd player
   ```
   
   From there, leverage the GitHub CLI to create and set up your fork:
   
   ```bash
   gh repo fork
   ```
   
   This command creates the fork for us from the repo we've cloned, sets up a new remote to publish to, and renames the previous remote so we can easily reference it:
   
   ```bash
   $ git remote -v
   origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/player.git (fetch)
   origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/player.git (push)
   upstream        https://github.com/player-ui/player.git (fetch)
   upstream        https://github.com/player-ui/player.git (push)
   ```

3. **Set Up Development Environment**
   
   Follow the [requirements setup](/contributing/#requirements) and install the necessary tools and dependencies.

4. **Choose Your Platform**

## Keeping Your Fork Updated

To keep your fork in sync with the main repository, you can leverage the upstream remote that was created when you set up your fork:

```bash
# Make sure we're on main branch first
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git push origin main
```

This allows you to quickly take everything that the main repo has on main and push it back up to your fork. You should do this anytime you want to contribute to ensure you don't have a stale branch with outdated files.

> **Alternative Method**: You can also create forks and PRs through [GitHub's web interface](https://github.com/player-ui/player) if you prefer not to use the CLI.


## Making Your First Contribution

### Good First Issues

Look for issues labeled with:
- <Badge text="good first issue" variant="tip" /> - Perfect for newcomers
- <Badge text="help wanted" variant="note" /> - Community contributions welcome
- <Badge text="documentation" variant="caution" /> - Great for getting familiar with the codebase

### Example Development Workflow

<Steps>

1. **Create a Branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make Your Changes**

   - Write your code
   - Add or update tests
   - Update documentation if needed

3. **Test Your Changes**

   ```bash
   # Run relevant tests
   bazel test //path/to/your:tests

   # For broader testing
   bazel test //...
   ```

4. **Commit Your Changes**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -S -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```

   <Aside type="note" title="Signed Commits Required">
     The <code>-S</code> flag signs your commit. Only signed commits can be merged. This is not the only way to sign commits. 
     Please review the full signing documentation 
     <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.
   </Aside>

5. **Push and Create Pull Request**

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

   When you're ready to submit a Pull Request, there's a great CLI command for that too:

   ```bash
   gh pr create
   ```
   
   This will guide you through writing your PR and creating it for the repo. You can also quickly monitor the status of the CI checks with:

   ```bash
   gh pr checks
   ```
   
   This will show all checks that have run on your PR and if they have passed or failed, and additionally add any links to quickly jump to the checks to debug.

</Steps>

## Getting Help

### Community Resources

- **[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/player-ui/player/issues)**: Ask questions or report problems
- **[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/player-ui/player/discussions)**: General questions and community chat  
- **Pull Request Reviews**: Get feedback on your code

### Code Review Process

1. Automated checks will run on your PR (tests, linting, builds)
2. A maintainer will review your code
3. Address any feedback from reviewers
4. Once approved, your PR will be merged!
