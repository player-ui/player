This guide covers everything you need to know for contributing to Player on Android, from initial setup to troubleshooting common issues.

## Local Development with Android Studio

This setup has been tested on Android Studio Chipmunk (2021.2.1) and Android Studio Giraffe (2022.3.1), though other versions may work as well.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have read the [main contributing requirements](/contributing/#requirements) first.

### Setup Steps

1. **Install Required SDKs**
   - Once you have Android Studio installed, go to **Tools → SDK Manager → SDK Platforms**
   - Make sure you have **only** the following SDK installed: **Android API 33**

2. **Configure SDK Build Tools and NDK**
   - Click on the **SDK Tools** tab
   - Make sure you have only the following versions installed:
     - **30.0.3** (SDK Build Tools)
     - **27.1.12297006** (NDK)

3. **Create Android Emulator**
   - Click on **Device Manager** and create a new device
   - You will need to download an **Sv2** system image
   - You should now be able to click the play button to start your emulator

4. **Build the Project**
   ```bash
   bazel build //android/demo
   ```

5. **Run the Demo App**
   
   You have several options to install and run the APK on your device:

   **Option 1: Direct run (recommended)**
   ```bash
   bazel run //android:demo
   ```

   **Option 2: Install command**
   ```bash
   bazel run //android/demo:install
   ```

   **Option 3: Manual installation**
   If the above commands don't work, you can manually install the APK:
   1. Find the APK at: `bazel-bin/android/demo/install.runfiles/player/android/demo/demo.apk`
   2. Drag this APK file onto your emulated Android device
   3. This will install the app (you may need to swipe on the device to see the application)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during setup or development, check the [Troubleshooting Guide](/contributing/troubleshooting) for solutions to common Android development problems.

## Development Tips

- The Android emulator needs to be running before executing bazel run commands
