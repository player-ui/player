Getting started with Player is simple.

### Install Dependencies

The first dependency you'll need to pull in is the Player itself. Additionally, you'll need an assets plugin to define any UI -- we'll use the reference assets as an example.

<PlatformTabs>
  <Fragment slot='react'>

You can do this by installing the React Player and Reference Assets Packages

<PackageManagers pkg="@player-ui/react @player-ui/reference-assets-plugin-react" />

  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot='ios'>

Add the following to your `Package.swift` dependencies:

```swift
.package(name: "PlayerUI", url: "https://github.com/player-ui/player.git", from: "0.2.0"),
.package(name: "PlayerUIReferenceAssets", url: "https://github.com/player-ui/player.git", from: "0.2.0")
```

And to your target's dependencies:

```swift
.product(name: "PlayerUI", package: "PlayerUI"),
.product(name: "PlayerUIReferenceAssets", package: "PlayerUIReferenceAssets")
```

  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot='android'>

Add the Player dependency to your `build.gradle` file:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("com.intuit.playerui:player:$PLAYER_VERSION")
    implementation("com.intuit.playerui:reference-assets:$PLAYER_VERSION")
}
```

  </Fragment>
</PlatformTabs>

### Create Your First Flow

Player content is defined using a JSON structure that describes the user experience. Here's a simple example:

```json
{
  "id": "my-first-flow",
  "views": [
    {
      "id": "welcome",
      "type": "info",
      "title": {
        "asset": {
          "id": "welcome-title",
          "type": "text",
          "value": "Welcome to Player!"
        }
      },
      "primaryInfo": {
        "asset": {
          "id": "welcome-message",
          "type": "text",
          "value": "This is your first Player experience."
        }
      },
      "actions": [
        {
          "asset": {
            "id": "continue-btn",
            "type": "action",
            "value": "Continue",
            "label": {
              "asset": {
                "id": "continue-label",
                "type": "text",
                "value": "Continue"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "navigation": {
    "BEGIN": "FLOW_1",
    "FLOW_1": {
      "startState": "VIEW_1",
      "VIEW_1": {
        "state_type": "VIEW",
        "ref": "welcome",
        "transitions": {
          "continue": "END_Done"
        }
      },
      "END_Done": {
        "state_type": "END",
        "outcome": "done"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Initialize the Player

<PlatformTabs>
  <Fragment slot='react'>

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { ReactPlayer } from "@player-ui/react";
import { ReferenceAssetsPlugin } from "@player-ui/reference-assets-plugin-react";

const flow = {
  /* your flow JSON here */
};

export default function App() {
  return <ReactPlayer plugins={[new ReferenceAssetsPlugin()]} flow={flow} />;
}
```

  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot='ios'>

```swift
import SwiftUI
import PlayerUI
import PlayerUIReferenceAssets

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        SwiftUIPlayer(
            flow: flow,
            plugins: [ReferenceAssetsPlugin()]
        )
    }
}
```

  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot='android'>

```kotlin
import com.intuit.playerui.core.player.Player
import com.intuit.playerui.plugins.reference.ReferenceAssetsPlugin

class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

        val player = Player(listOf(ReferenceAssetsPlugin()))
        player.start(flow)
    }
}
```

  </Fragment>
</PlatformTabs>

That's it! You now have a basic Player experience running. Check out the other guides to learn more about building complex flows and customizing your experiences.
