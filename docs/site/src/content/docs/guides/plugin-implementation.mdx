title: Plugin Implementation
---

The main purpose of a Plugin is to extend or add new functionality by tapping into Player's pipeline of components via hooks. In this section we'll go over the steps to implement a plugin.

We'll use the [stage-revert-data](./plugins/stage-revert-data) plugin as example. After creating our plugin class, we'll use the `apply` method which provides access to the Player instance, which then gives access to the necessary hooks.

```typescript
export default class StageRevertDataPlugin implements PlayerPlugin {
  name = 'stage-revert-data-plugin';

  apply(player: Player) {
    let dataController: DataController;
    let stageData: String;
    let commitTransitions: String[];
    let commitShadowModel: Boolean = false;

    const GatedDataMiddleware = new ValidationMiddleware(
      () =>
        commitShadowModel
          ? undefined
          : {
              message: 'staging data',
              severity: 'error',
            },
      { shouldIncludeInvalid: () => true }
    );
```

For this case we needed to define variables that will store references for the scope the hooks will share:

- `dataController`: Reference to the data controller hook in the Player instance, can be used to read, update or commit new changes to the data model
- `stageData`: View attribute that comes from the view state, used for enabling the staging of data
- `commitTransitions`: The list of view names which the shadow model should be committed if transitioned to. Comes from the view state attribute as well.
- `commitShadowModel`: Flag that enables committing shadow model into data model after the transition, only if `stageData` is set to true and the next target view name is included in `commitTransitions`.
- `GatedDataMiddleware` Instance from `ValidationMiddleware` to be used as a middleware to intercept the data-model pipeline before any data is committed and cache the data instead, only if `stageData` is set to true.

The next step is to tap into the necessary Player hooks. First we tap into the `viewController` which we can then intercept the `resolveView` hook. Player hooks are implemented with the [Tapable](https://github.com/webpack/tapable) package, so we can use the interception API's `call` method, this triggers everytime the hook is triggered, then we get access to the current view state and read the `stageData` and `commitTransitions` attributes.

```typescript
player.hooks.viewController.tap(this.name, (vc) => {
  vc.hooks.resolveView.intercept({
    call: (view, id, state) => {
      stageData = state?.attributes?.stageData;
      commitTransitions = state?.attributes?.commitTransitions;
    },
  });
});
```

`Note`: notice how each time we tap into a hook, we use the `this.name` property as the name of the plugin. This is important to avoid conflicts with other plugins.

Next we tap into the `dataController`, so we can scope the data controller instance for future use. Then we tap into the `resolveDataStages` plugin in this data controller instance. If the `stage` property is set to true, we add our `GatedDataMiddleware` to the data pipeline. If not, we return the data pipeline as is.

```typescript
player.hooks.dataController.tap(this.name, (dc: DataController) => {
  dataController = dc;

  dc.hooks.resolveDataStages.tap(this.name, (dataPipeline) => {
    return stageData
      ? [...dataPipeline, GatedDataMiddleware]
      : [...dataPipeline];
  });
});
```

Finally, we tap into the `flowController` so we can intercept the `flow` hook. We then tap into the `transition` hook, which is called every time the player transitions from one view to another. If the `commitTransitions` includes the next view name, we set the `commitShadowModel` flag to true, and commit the data stored in the shadow model through `GatedDataMiddleware` into the data model. Whether the data was committed from the shadow model or not, we clear the shadow model paths in the `GatedDataMiddleware` instance and set the `commitShadowModel` flag to false as final steps.

```typescript
player.hooks.flowController.tap(this.name, (flowController) => {
  flowController.hooks.flow.tap(this.name, (flow) => {
    flow.hooks.transition.tap(this.name, (from, to) => {
      if (from) {
        if (commitTransitions.includes(to.name)) {
          commitShadowModel = true;
          player.logger.debug(
            "Shadow Model Data to be committed %s",
            GatedDataMiddleware.shadowModelPaths,
          );
          dataController.set(GatedDataMiddleware.shadowModelPaths);
        }

        commitShadowModel = false;
        GatedDataMiddleware.shadowModelPaths.clear();
      }
    });
  });
});
```

And this is how we implement a plugin that manages the staging of data based on the view state attributes.
