# Multi-Flow Experiences

One large use-case for Player involves orchestrating experiences that span multiple screens that may need to communicate with a back-end between stages. This is commonly used for stepped-flows, onboarding workflows, etc, and manifests as using the response from one Player flow to determine the next one. To facilitate this back-and-forth, Player ships with support for creating a flow-manager.

## Flow Manager

A flow-manager is an interface for asynchronously stepping through a series of flows in a multi-flow experience. Its API mirrors that of the JavaScript [iteration protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols); each flow is loaded by calling `.next()` using the result of the previous flow (if one exists). Implementations are able to leverage this response to retrieve the _next_ flow in the series, or mark the cycle as complete by returning `done`.

![Flow Manager](/flow-manager.png?darkModeInvert)

The standardization of this contract allows any client to manage a series of Player flows without needing to repeat the underlying Player-side orchestration.

An abridged version of the API is described below:

```typescript
interface FlowManager {
  /**
   * An iterator implementation that takes the result of the previous flow and returns a new one or completion marker.
   * If `done: true` is returned, the multi-flow experience is completed.
   *
   * @param previousValue - The result of the previous flow.
   */
  next: (prevResponse: CompletedState) => Promise<FinalState | NextState<Flow>>;

  /**
   * Called when the flow is ended early (the react tree is torn down)
   * Allows clients the opportunity to save-data before destroying the tree
   */
  terminate?: (player: Player) => void;
}
```

Shown above is also an optional `terminate` callback. This is used when a flow is ended prematurely (user closes a view) as a means of gathering any critical information from the running player before shutting down.

## Managed Player

<PlatformTabs>
  <Fragment slot='react'>

The `ManagedPlayer` component from the `@player-ui/react` module orchestrates running flows through Player using a provided `flow-manager`. Any provided configuration/plugins will be passed along to the underlying `ReactPlayer` instance, and `React.Suspense` is used while awaiting the next `flow-manager` response.

Simply render the `ManagedPlayer` with a flow-manager:

```tsx
import { ManagedPlayer } from "@player-ui/react";

export const App = () => {
  return <ManagedPlayer manager={myFlowManager} />;
};
```

### Callbacks and Error Handling

The `ManagedPlayer` also includes callbacks for `onComplete` and `onError` to handle the completion of a multi-flow experience.

The `fallbackComponent` is an optional prop that accepts a React component that will be rendered in case of an error. It's given access to the thrown `Error` object, as well as a `retry` and `reset` callback:

- `retry` -- Retries the last failed request (the last call to `next()`)
- `reset` -- Restarts the multi-flow from the begining, calling `next()` with an empty context.

  <Fragment slot='ios'>

The `ManagedPlayer` SwiftUI Component from the `PlayerUI/SwiftUI` subspec orchestrates running flows through Player using a provided `FlowManager`. Any provided configuration or plugins are passed along to the underlying `SwiftUIPlayer` instance.

When constructing the `ManagedPlayer` you supply views to be used for error scenarios, as well as what is displayed while the FlowManager is fetching flows.

### Error Handling

The `fallback` parameter receives a `ManagedPlayerErrorContext` object when called, this object contains the `Error` that was thrown, as well as `retry` and `reset` functions.

- `retry` -- Retries the last failed request (the last call to `next()`)
- `reset` -- Restarts the multi-flow from the begining, calling `next()` with an empty context.

```swift
import PlayerUI

struct App: View {
    var body: some View {
        ManagedPlayer(
            plugins: [...],
            flowManager: myFlowManager,
            onComplete: { result in },
            fallback: { errorContext in Text("Error!") },
            loading: { Text("Loading...") }
        )
    }
}
```
