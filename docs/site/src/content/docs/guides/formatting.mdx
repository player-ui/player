title: Data Formatting and Deformatting
---

Formatting is simply a conversion (or middleware) for getting and setting data. It's often used to convey a different representation of the data to a user (like displaying a date).

## References

In order to attach a specific formatter to a part of the data-model, you need to supply a _reference_. These can be defined in the [schema](/content/schema) or a DataType.

In either case, the reference to the applicable formatter looks identical:

```json
// An example of a formatter reference for a `date`
{
  "type": "date",
  "format": "MM/DD/YYYY"
}
```

The only _required_ property is the type. Any additional properties (`format` in this example) is passed to the formatter function as options. Not all formatters accept options, and they differ per format type.

Each binding can be mapped to 1 format at most. Any reference set directly on an item in the schema, will override an inherited format from a parent type.

## Formatting Lifecycle

There are 2 main steps in the formatting lifecycle `formatting` and `deformatting`. Each format type may define either or both.

Simply stated:

- `formatting`: **Data Model** -> **User**
- `deformatting`: **User** -> **Data Model**

In cases where the data-type may change between the user and the data-model (think epoch to a formatted time, or integers to a comma number) you'll likely want to specify both, though either, both, or neither is also valid.

## Using Formatted Data

In order to get or set formatted values from the model, add `formatted: true` to the options of the data-model method. This is most often through the use of a [transform](/plugins/asset-transform).

```javascript
function assetTransform(value, options) {
  return {
    ...value,
    formattedVersion: options.data.model.get('some binding', {
      formatted: true,
    }),
  };
}
```

This also works for setting data:

```javascript
options.data.model.set([['some binding', 'some value']], { formatted: true });
```

You can also use the `format` function directly from a transform:

```javascript
options.data.format('some binding', 'some value');
```

Using the `format` function will not mutate any data in the model.

## Defining Custom formats

### Creating a format-type

A custom format-type is defined by an object with a `name`, an optional `format` handler, and an optional `deformat` handler.

Each `format` or `deformat` function takes a `value` and some `options` (those defined in the format reference) and returns a new value to use. Format handlers should not contain any side-effects as they can be ran multiple times and are expected to be pure functions.

### Registering a custom format

The easiest way to add the custom format to the player is through the `types-provider` plugin.

Create your format object, and add register it with the plugin:

```javascript
import { TypesProviderPlugin } from '@player-ui/types-provider-plugin';

const provider = new TypesProviderPlugin({
  formats: [
    {
      name: 'custom-formatter',
      format: () => 'formatted-value',
      deformat: () => 'deformatted-value',
    },
  ],
});
```

Now any DataType or schema reference to `custom-formatter` will use this handler.
