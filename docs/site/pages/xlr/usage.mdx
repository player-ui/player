title: Using XLR
---

# Part 1 - Creating XLRs

XLR creation is done through the Player CLI which can be added to your project like so:

```bash
yarn install @player-tools/cli
```

## Exporting Base Type Definitions

If you want to compile all exported interfaces/types to XLRs run the following command as part of your build

```bash
player xlr compile -m types <other options>
```

## Exporting Plugin Capabilities

If you are writing a Player Plugin, you'll first need to have your plugin extend the `ExtendedPlayerPlugin` interface and fill in the generics with an array of the interfaces/types for each Capability. For example, you can see how its done below in the [core reference assets plugin](https://github.com/player-ui/player/blob/main/plugins/reference-assets/core/src/plugin.ts)

```typescript
export class ReferenceAssetsPlugin
  implements
    PlayerPlugin,
    ExtendedPlayerPlugin<
      [InputAsset, TextAsset, ActionAsset, InfoAsset, CollectionAsset]
    >
```

Then run the following command as part of your build

```shell
player xlr compile -m plugin <other options>
```

# Part 2 - Using XLRs 

## SDK: Initialization

To start using the XLR SDK you'll need to install the SDK package

```bash
yarn install @player-tools/xlr-sdk
```

Next, import the SDK 

```typescript
import { XLRSDK } from "@player-tools/xlr-sdk"
```

_If you want to implement a custom object store, also import the `XLRRegistry` interface and have your custom registry implement it._

Lastly, just initialize an instance of it. 

```typescript
import { XLRSDK } from "@player-tools/xlr-sdk"

const sdk = new XLRSDK();
```

or if you want to use your custom registry, just pass it in to the initializer. 

```typescript
import { XLRSDK } from "@player-tools/xlr-sdk"
import { customRegistry } from "./customRegistry"

const sdk = new XLRSDK(customRegistry);
```

## SDK: Loading Types

If you want to load XLR types from disk, you can use the `loadDefinitionsFromDisk` function and pass it the path to parent folder of the `xlr` directory.

```typescript
const sdk = new XLRSDK();
sdk.loadDefinitionsFromDisk('./common/static_xlrs/core');
```

If you want to load XLR types from a module, you can use the `loadDefinitionsFromModule` function and pass it the module to load from.

```typescript
const sdk = new XLRSDK();
sdk.loadDefinitionsFromModule(require("@player-ui/reference-assets-plugin").path);
```

- If you want to filter any of the types that are being loaded, you can supply a `Filters` object as the *second* arguments
- If you want to apply any transform functions to the modules that you load, you can supply a list of `TransformFunction` as the *third* argument

## SDK: Usage

After the types are loaded into the SDK there are a couple ways to interact with them.

### Type Recall

To get a type back you can use the `getType` function and pass the name of the type you want to retrieve. You can also use the `hasType` function to check to see if the type exists before you try and access it. 

```typescript
const sdk = new XLRSDK();
if(sdk.hasType("InputAsset")){
  return sdk.getType("InputAsset")
} else {
  throw new Error("Oh no!")
}
```

### Type Validation

To validate if some JSON content matches the expected type, you can use the `validateType` function. You will need to supply a `Node` from the `jsonc-parser` library. 

```typescript
import { parseTree } from 'jsonc-parser';
import { XLRSDK } from '@player-tools/xlr-sdk'

const sdk = new XLRSDK();

///... Loading XLRs

const mockAsset = parseTree(`
    {
      "id": 1,
      "type": "input",
      "binding": "some.data",
      "label": {
        "asset": {
          "value": "{{input.label}}"
        }
      }
    `);

return sdk.validate('InputAsset', mockAsset)
```
