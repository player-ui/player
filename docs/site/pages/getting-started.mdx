# Getting Started

Getting started with Player is simple.

### Install Dependencies

The first dependency you'll need to pull in is the Player itself. Additionally, you'll need an assets plugin to define any UI -- we'll use the reference assets as an example.

<PlatformTabs>
  <react>

You can do this by running

```bash
yarn add @player-ui/react
yarn add @player-ui/reference-assets-plugin-react
```

or

```bash
npm install @player-ui/react
npm install @player-ui/reference-assets-plugin-react
```
  </react>
  <ios>

In your `Podfile` you'll need to add `PlayerUI` as a dependency and the `ReferenceAssets` plugin to use the base set of assets.

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/player-ui/player'

target 'MyApp' do
  # Add the pod to your target
  pod 'PlayerUI'
  pod 'PlayerUI/ReferenceAssets' # For example only
end
```
  </ios>
  <android>

Configure the Android Player dependencies in your `build.gradle(.kts)` files.

```kotlin
dependencies {
    // Android Player
    implementation("com.intuit.player.android:player:$playerVersion")
    // Optional - reference assets
    implementation("com.intuit.player.android:assets:$playerVersion")
}
```

#### Release Optimization

The Android Player dependency automatically pulls in both the `dev` as well as the `prod` versions of the underlying JS scripts.

The `dev` scripts are handy for debugging shared JS code through the JS debugger in debug builds, but they are not necessary for consumer facing release builds.

To optimize the release bundles, it is highly recommended to exclude the `dev` scripts, as well as enabling V8 to strip out unused code from the final bundle.

```kotlin
buildTypes {
    getByName("release") {
        isMinifyEnabled = true
        isShrinkResources = true
        packagingOptions {
            exclude("**/*.dev.js")
        }
    }
}
```
  </android>
</PlatformTabs>

### Configuration

Next, in your code you'll need to initialize Player. This is where you would also initialize any plugins you want to use with Player and create the configuration for Player itself. Below is a minimal example of this.

<PlatformTabs>
  <react>

```javascript
import { ReactPlayer } from '@player-ui/react';
import { ReferenceAssetsPlugin } from '@player-ui/reference-assets-plugin-react';

// create a new web-player instance

const reactPlayer = new ReactPlayer({
  plugins: [new ReferenceAssetsPlugin()],
});
```
  </react>
  <ios>

`SwiftUIPlayer` is just a normal SwiftUI View and can be inserted anywhere in your hierarchy.

```swift
import PlayerUI

var body: some View {
  SwiftUIPlayer(
    plugins: [ReferenceAssetsPlugin()],
  )
}
```
  </ios>

  <android>

```kotlin
// create Android Player with reference assets plugin
val player = AndroidPlayer(ReferenceAssetsPlugin())
```
  </android>
</PlatformTabs>

### Render Content
Now that you have a Player instance created. You'll need to start it with some [content](/content).

<PlatformTabs>

  <react>

```javascript
const content = {/* your content here */}
reactPlayer.start(content);
```

With Player running your content, you'll need to actually render out what is processes. To do this, you can use the React Player's component API to insert it into your React tree.

```javascript
const MyApp = () => {
  return <reactPlayer.Component />;
};
```
  </react>
  <ios>

Expanding on the `SwiftUIPlayer` creation above, providing a `flow` will start the Player automatically, and the `result` will update the `Binding<Result<CompletedState, PlayerError>?>` that you pass to it:

```swift
import PlayerUI

struct MyApp: View {
  @State var result: Result<CompletedState, PlayerError>? = nil
  @ObservedObject var viewModel: MyViewModel
  var body: some View {
    SwiftUIPlayer(
      flow: $viewModel.flowString,
      plugins: [ReferenceAssetsPlugin()],
      result: $result
    )
  }
}
```
  </ios>
  <android>

To receive view updates, you must add a handler to render the views which are represented as `RenderableAsset`s.

```kotlin
// handle view updates - should be done before starting the Player
player.onUpdate { asset: RenderableAsset? ->
    // render asset as View `into` view tree
    asset?.render() into binding.playerContainer
}

// start Player
player.start(content)
```

When you're done with Player, release any native runtime memory used to instantiate Player or run the flow.

```kotlin
player.release()
```

Creating your own `AndroidPlayer` instance is fairly simple, but it grows in complexity when considering proper resources management and app orchestration. We provide a Fragment/ViewModel integration to make it easier to properly integrate into your app and account for these concerns. 

#### ViewModel

With the `PlayerViewModel` and `PlayerFragment`, the above orchestration is done for you. All that is needed is to provide concrete implementations of each and add the fragment to your app.

##### PlayerViewModel

The `PlayerViewModel` requires an `AsyncFlowIterator` to be supplied in the constructor. The AsyncFlowIterator is what tells Player which flows to run. This can be hardcoded into the view model or expected as an argument, as shown below.

```kotlin
class SimplePlayerViewModel(flows: AsyncFlowIterator) : PlayerViewModel(flows) {
    override val plugins = listOf(ReferenceAssetsPlugin())
}
```

##### PlayerFragment

The `PlayerFragment` is a simple Android `Fragment` that only requires a specific `PlayerViewModel` to be defined. If your view model requires the `AsyncFlowIterator` to be passed as part of the constructor, you can leverage the `PlayerViewModel.Factory` to produce it, as shown below.

Specifically, this fragment takes a flow as an argument to the constructor and creates a single-flow `AsyncFlowIterator` instance using the pseudo-constructor helper.

```kotlin
class SimplePlayerFragment(override val flow: String) : PlayerFragment() {
    override val playerViewModel by viewModels<SimplePlayerViewModel> {
        PlayerViewModel.Factory(AsyncFlowIterator(flow), ::SimplePlayerViewModel)
    }
}
```
  </android>
</PlatformTabs>

Congrats! You've got Player up and running. If you need additional functionality you can add more plugins to extend Player's functionality. Head over to the [Plugins](./plugins) section to take a look at the Plugins we've developed or take a look at the [Architecture](./architecture) section to see how you can write your own.
