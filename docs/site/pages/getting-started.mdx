# Getting Started

Getting started with Player is simple. Below we have guides per platform on how to integrate Player into your platform of choice. 

## React 

### Install Dependencies

The first dependency you'll need to pull in in the React Player itself. You can do this by running

```bash
yarn add @player-ui/react
```

or 

```bash
npm install @player-ui/react
```

### Configuration

Next, in your code you'll need to initialize Player. This is where you would also initialize any plugins you want to use with Player and create the configuration for Player itself. Below is a minimal example of this. 

```javascript
import { WebPlayer } from '@player-ui/react';
import { ReferenceAssetsPlugin } from '@player-ui/reference-assets-plugin-react';

// create a new web-player instance

const webPlayer = new WebPlayer({
  plugins: [new ReferenceAssetsPlugin()],
});
```

### Render Content

Now that you have a Player instance created. You'll need to start it with some content.

```javascript
const content = {/* your content here */}
webPlayer.start(content);
```

With Player running your content, you'll need to actually render out what is processes. To do this, you can use the React Player's component API to inster it into your React tree. 

```javascript
const MyApp = () => {
  return <webPlayer.Component />;
};
```

Congrats! You've got Player up and running. If you need additional functionality you can add more plugins to extend Player's functionality. Head over to the [Plugins](./plugins) section to take a look at the Plugins we've developed or take a look at the [Architecture](./architecture) section to see how you can write your own. 

## iOS (Swift)

### Install Dependencies

In your `Podfile` you'll need to add `PlayerUI` as a dependency and the `ReferenceAssets` plugin to use the base set of assets. 

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/player-ui/player'

target 'MyApp' do
  # Add the pod to your target
  pod 'PlayerUI'
  pod 'PlayerUI/ReferenceAssets' # For example only
end
```

### Configuration

The `SwiftUIPlayer` is just a normal SwiftUI View and can be inserted anywhere in your hierarchy. The flow will start automatically, and the result will update the `Binding<Result<CompletedState, PlayerError>?>` that you pass to it:

```swift
import PlayerUI

struct MyApp: View {
  @State var result: Result<CompletedState, PlayerError>? = nil
  @ObservedObject var viewModel: MyViewModel
  var body: some View {
    SwiftUIPlayer(
      flow: $viewModel.flowString,
      plugins: [ReferenceAssetsPlugin()],
      result: $result
    )
  }
}
```

## JVM/Android

### Install Dependencies

Configure the Android Player dependencies in your Gradle files. You'll also need to add a plugin that provides asset definitions and components. To get started, we are going to use the reference set provided by the Android Player. _Note: The reference asset set isn't intended for production use. It exists as an example of how to create an Android asset and can be used to help get started. _

<Gradle language="Kotlin">

```kotlin
// Add Android Player dependencies
dependencies {
    // Android Player
    implementation("com.intuit.player.android", "player", androidPlayerVersion)
    // Optional - reference asset set
    implementation("com.intuit.player.android", "assets", referenceAssetsVersion)
}
```

</Gradle>  
<Gradle language="Groovy">

```groovy
// Add Android Player dependencies
dependencies {
    // Android Player
    implementation "com.intuit.player.android:player:$androidPlayerVersion"
    // Optional - reference asset set
    implementation "com.intuit.player.android:assets:$referenceAssetsVersion"
}
```

</Gradle>
<Maven>

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.intuit.player.jvm</groupId>
    <artifactId>core</artifactId>
    <version>3.2.1</version>
</dependency>
```

</Maven>
</Tabs>

### Configuration

All you need to create an `AndroidPlayer` instance is the Android Context and any plugins you want.

```kotlin
// create Android Player with reference assets plugin
val player = AndroidPlayer(context, ReferenceAssetsPlugin())
```

Once you have a Player, you must add a handler for view updates, which are represented as RenderableAssets. 

```kotlin
// handle view updates
player.onUpdate { asset: RenderableAsset? ->
    // render asset as View
    val view: View = asset?.render()
    // add view to screen
}
```

### Usage

#### Basic
With the Android Player and handler configured, all that's left is starting a flow. This is done by calling
start with a JSON string containing your Player content.

```kotlin
player.start(content)
```

When you're done with Player, release any native runtime memory used to instantiate Player or run the flow.

```kotlin
player.release()
```

#### ViewModel

With the `PlayerViewModel` and `PlayerFragment`, the above orchestration is done for you. All that is needed is to provide concrete implementations of each and add the fragment to your app.

##### PlayerViewModel
The `PlayerViewModel` is an `AndroidViewModel` meaning it requires the actual Android `Application` as well as an `AsyncFlowIterator` to be supplied in the constructor. The AsyncFlowIterator is what tells Player which flows to run. This can be hardcoded into the view model or expected as an argument, as shown below.

```kotlin
class SimplePlayerViewModel(application: Application, flows: AsyncFlowIterator) : PlayerViewModel(application, flows) {
    override val plugins = listOf(ReferenceAssetsPlugin())
}
```

##### PlayerFragment

The `PlayerFragment` is a simple Android `Fragment` that only requires a specific `PlayerViewModel` to be defined. If your view model requires the AsyncFlowIterator to be passed as part of the constructor, you can leverage the `PlayerViewModel.Factory` to produce it, as shown below.

Specifically, this fragment takes a flow as an argument to the constructor and creates a single-flow `AsyncFlowIterator` instance using the pseudo-constructor helper.

```kotlin
class SimplePlayerFragment(override val flow: String) : PlayerFragment() {
    override val playerViewModel by viewModels<SimplePlayerViewModel> {
        PlayerViewModel.Factory(requireActivity().application, AsyncFlowIterator(flow), ::SimplePlayerViewModel)
    }
}
```
