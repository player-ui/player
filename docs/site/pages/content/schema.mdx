# Schema

The `schema` section of the content describes the relationship between the `view` and the `data`. It breaks down properties of the model's object into data-types, each with their own spot for validation, formatting, or default-values.

## Structure

The _root_ of the data object uses the `ROOT` keyword in the schema:

```json
{
  "ROOT": {
    "myProperty1": {
      "type": "MyCustomType"
    }
  }
}
```

This describes a `myProperty1` key on the data-model which corresponds to a _type_ of `MyCustomType`. Structural data-types can be added to the schema as a sibling to `ROOT` and are referenced by name from the previous type.

To add a `name` property to the `myProperty1` example:

```json
{
  "ROOT": {
    "myProperty1": {
      "type": "MyCustomType"
    }
  },
  "MyCustomType": {
    "name": {
      "type": "StringType"
    }
  }
}
```

Now the path `myProperty1.name` in the model points to a `StringType`. There are a number of basic built-in core types, like `StringType`, that provide a base set of formatting/validation/default value support out of the box. Read more about those below.

## Data Types

A `DataType` is a collection of the validation rules, formatting, and default values for a given path in the model. See the above [structure](#Structure) docs on how to author these in JSON content.

As in the above `StringType` example, there are a number of pre-existing base types that can be utilized in the schema to describe a data type, and an extension mechanism for supplying additional base-types for use in the authored content. See the [types-provider-plugin](/plugins/types-provider) for an easy way to extend these.

For any given path described by the schema, Player will merge the rules defined by the _base_ type (if one exists), and the rules defined specifically for that path in the authored content. Any custom formatter/default values take precedence over the default ones, and any custom validations are ran _before_ the base ones.

Check out the [CommonTypes](/plugins/common-types) plugin for a list of easy to consume DataTypes for your application.

## Arrays

Sometimes the data you're using represents an array or list of things. To indicate this in the schema add a `isArray: true` property to the reference of the top level array. For example, if the data you're representing looks like:

```json
{
  "pets": [
    {
      "name": "Frodo",
      "type": "cat"
    },
    {
      "name": "Ginger",
      "type": "dog"
    }
  ]
}
```

the corresponding schema would be:

```json
{
  "ROOT": {
    "pets": {
      "type": "PetType",
      "isArray": true
    }
  },
  "PetType": {
    "name": {
      "type": "StringType"
    },
    "type": {
      "type": "StringType"
    }
  }
}
```

Each item in the array will be formatted/validated using the same rule-set.

## Validation

To attach a validation to a path in the data-model, add a reference to a validator in the data-type definition for that path under a `validation` property:

```json
{
  "MyCustomType": {
    "name": {
      "type": "StringType",
      "validation": [
        {
          "type": "length",
          "max": 20,
          "min": 5
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Each _validation_ reference must include a `type` property which corresponds to the name of the validator to run. Player includes some validators out-of-the-box, and custom `validators` can be registered as well. See [here]() for more details around which validators are supported, and how to add custom ones.

Any additional properties on the validation reference are passed as _options_ to the `validator`. In the example above, a hypothetical `length` validator can take a `min` and `max` as the boundaries for the length of a string.

## Formatting

Similar to adding validations, formatting is added to a data-type through a reference to a `formatter`.

```json
{
  "MyCustomType": {
    "name": {
      "type": "NumberType",
      "format": {
        "type": "commaNumber",
        "decimalPlaces": 3
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Just like in validations, the `type` of the formatter corresponds to the name of a formatter to use (`commaNumber` in this case). This hypothetical `commaNumber` formatter would be responsible for translating the data stored in the model to/from what's displayed to the user. Any additional properties on the `format` object get passed to the respective formatter function as options. In the above example, the options would include `{ decimalPlaces: 3 }`.

Custom formatters can be registered with Player, and thus exposed for use within the authored content.

The transition from the data stored in the _model_ to the user is considered _formating_ where the inverse (what a user sees to the _model_ is _deformatting_). Not every formatter has a handler for both _formatting_ and _deformatting_, and it's entirely up the formatter to define the requirements for data handling in these scenarios.

## Default Value

Any schema or data type can supply a default value to use when setting or getting the value from the data-model.
Simply supply the `default` property in either the type reference in the schema or the base type definition. Any read from a binding with a `default` property will return it's default if the underlying model's value is undefined. **Note:** Reading a value (and it's default) will not _set_ the value in the model to it's default. The exception to this rule is for bindings that are tracked for validations.
