# Switches

Switches are ways of dynamically changing the structure of the view based on data. There are 2 types of switches: `static` and `dynamic`, but their structures are identical. `switches` can appear anywhere you'd find a normal asset, and (similar to [templates](./templates)) are removed from the view before it reaches the UI layer.

## Schema

The switch is simply a list of objects with `case` and `asset` properties:

- `asset` - The asset that will replace the switch if the case is true
- `case` - An [expression](./expression) to evaluate.

The switch will run through each _case_ statement until the first case expression evaluates to true. For the _default_ case, simple use a value of `true` at the end of the array.

## `Static` vs `Dynamic`

The only difference between a `static` and `dynamic` switch is the timing update behavior after the first rendering of a view.

A `staticSwitch` calculates the applicable case when a view first renders. It will not re-calculate any of the case statements as data in the view is updated. If you transition away from view-node, and revisit it later-on in the flow, the switch will re-compute the appropriate case statement.

A `dynamicSwitch` will always update the applicable case statement whenever data changes. If data is changed while a view is still showing, the switch will be updated to reflect the new case.

## Example

Anywhere you can place an `asset` node, a `dynamicSwitch` or `staticSwitch` can be placed instead.

```json
{
  "staticSwitch": [
    {
      "case": "{{name.first}} == 'adam'",
      "asset": {
        "id": "name",
        "type": "text",
        "value": "Yay"
      }
    },
    {
      "case": "{{name.first}} == 'margie'",
      "asset": {
        "id": "name",
        "type": "text",
        "value": "Nay"
      }
    },
    {
      "case": true,
      "asset": {
        "id": "name",
        "type": "text",
        "value": "ðŸ¤·"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
