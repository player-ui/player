# Data

Data is central to a lot of the functionality and features of Player. The easiest way to deal with data is to supply it in the initial payload when starting a flow. This will _seed_ the model with data and allow you to easily reference values

## Bindings

A binding is a representation of a path within the data-model. In simple terms, it's a dot (`.`) separated string showing the path of the properties within the data object.

Given the following data model:

```js
data: {
  foo: {
    bar: {
      baz: "hello world!"
    },
    array: [
      {
        property: "another value"
      }
    ]
  },
}
```

Then the binding `foo.bar.baz` will reference the value `"hello world!"`. Assets that write data to the data model would overwrite `"hello world"` when setting to that binding. Using brackets instead of the dot-notation is accepted, similar to accessig properties in real Javascript objects. Unlike Javascript, when using the bracket-notation, surrounding quotes are only required if you need a literal `[` or `]` in your property name.

The following bindings are all equivalent:

- `foo.bar.baz`
- `foo['bar']["baz"]`
- `foo[bar].baz`

For most bindings, it is recommended to use the dot-notation for all properties when possible. Doing so is consistent, simpler, and the most performant.

Note that you can also use integers to access into arrays in the data model. `foo.bar.array.0.property` will reference `"another value"`.

### Query Syntax

Bindings also allow for query access into arrays using a `key`/`value` pair to find the first matching item in the array.

The query syntax takes the form `array[key=value]`. Where `key` is the property name you want to compare and `value` is the value you want to match against. The binding resolves to the first item in the array that has a matching property and value.

```js
data: {
  model: {
    array: [
      {
        name: 'alpha',
        foo: 'bar',
      },
      {
        name: 'bravo',
        foo: 'baz',
      },
      {
        name: 'charlie',
        foo: 'qux',
      },
    ];
  }
}
```

For the given data, the following bindings are all equivalent and will point to the first element in the array:

- `model.array[0]`
- `model.array[name="alpha"]`
- `model.array[foo="bar"]`

Quotes around the key or the value of the query are only required when needing to use ambiguous literal characters, such as `[`, `]`, or `=`.

Note that the query syntax resolves to the object of the matching query, not to any specific property on the object. If you want to access a specific property, add additional path information after the query. E.g., `model.array[name=bravo].name`.

### Nested Bindings

Nested bindings allow you to construct a binding path that is relative to a 2nd path or based on some dynamic property. This behavior follows similar model lookup rules that can be used elsewhere in Player.

The syntax for a nested binding is a subpath that is wrapped in double curly braces. E.g., `normal.path.{{nested.path}}.more.normal.path`.

```js
data: {
  colors: {
    yellow: {
      hex: "#ffff00"
      rgb: "rgb(255, 255, 0)"
    },
    red: {
      hex: "#ff0000",
      rgb: "rgb(255, 0, 0)"
    }
  },
  favorites: {
    color: "yellow",
    food: "tacos",
    nestedPath: "colors.yellow"
  }
}
```

With this data model, `colors.{{favorite.color}}.hex` will return the hex value for yellow, `"#ffff00"`. Any syntax for a regular binding is also valid as part of a nested binding, including further nesting.

References to bindings that contains sub-paths `{{favorite.nestedPath}}.hex` will expand to `colors.yellow.hex`.

### Nested Expressions

Just like binding segments can contain other bindings, segments can also contain expressions. For this, they use a segment surrounded by `:

Suppose there exists a `getFavoriteColor()` expression that returns `yellow`. The following path would resolve to `colors.yellow.hex`.

```
colors.`getFavoriteColor()`.hex
```

Similar to the bracket notation: `[]`. Paths can use brackets instead of dots for paths:

```
colors[`getFavoriteColor()`].hex
```

# Expressions

Expressions are callable functions that allow for dynamic behavior of Player and it's views.

These functions can be used in `ACTION` nodes in the navigation section, calculated values in a property of an asset, or anywhere else expressions are valid.

Check out the [Expression Plugin](../plugins/expression) for registering custom functions.

## Using Expressions and Data in a View

Expressions in the view are strings wrapped in: `@[` and `]@`.

For instance, to call a `sum` expression you may use:

```json
{
  "value": "The sum is @[ sum(1, 2, 3) ]@ dollars"
}
```

Player will handle resolving that value into the proper string before handing it to the UI layers to render. (`{ "value": "The sum is 6 dollars" }`)

If an expression is the sole property value:

```json
{
  "value": "@[ sum(1, 2, 3) ]@"
}
```

The _raw_ value of the expression will replace that property rather than being wrapped in a string: `{ "value": 6 }`

Data is referenced by wrapping the binding in `{{` and `}}`. This can be used in an expression: `@[ {{foo.bar}} + {{foo.baz}} ]@` or within a string: `{ "value": "Hello {{foo.name}}" }`

Similar to expressions, any property only consisting of a data value lookup, will get replaced by the raw value.

## Using Expressions for Inline Text Formatting

`format` expression is used to replace provided value with appropriate format.
For instance, to format a number into `currency`, you may use:

```json
{
  "value": "Total amount is: @[ format('12122016', 'currency') ]@"
}
```

To see the list of currently supported format types, check out [Common Types Plugin](../plugins/common-types.md).

## Built-in Expressions

There are a few expressions built into Player. These are pretty basic, so if you're looking for extend this -- check out the [Common Expressions Plugin](../plugins/common-expressions) or the [Expression Plugin](../plugins/expression) to add more.

| name            | description                                                                           | arguments          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `getDataVal`    | Fetches a value from the model. This is equivalent to using the `{{foo.bar}}` syntax. | `binding`          |
| `setDataVal`    | Sets a value from the model. This is equivalent to using `{{foo.bar}} = 'value'`      | `binding`, `value` |
| `deleteDataVal` | Clears a value from the model.                                                        | `binding`          |
| `conditional`   | Execute expressions, or return data based on an expression condition                  | `condition`, `valueIfTrue`, `valueIfFalse` |

### Examples

#### `getDataVal` 
```json
{
  "value": "Hello @[getDataVal('user.name')]@"
}
```

#### `setDataVal` 
```json
{
  "exp": "setDataVal('user.name', 'Test User')"
}
```

#### `deleteDataVal` 
```json
{
  "exp": "deleteDataVal('user.name')"
}
```

#### `conditional` 
```json
{
  "value": "It is @[ conditional({{foo.bar}} == 'DAY', 'daytime', 'nighttime') ]@."
}
```
