title: Player + Storybook Integration

## Reference Assets

The reference asset set, complete with the storybook-plugin integration below is available [here](/storybook-demo)

## Storybook Plugin

The `@player-ui/storybook` package is a storybook addon + wrapper that provides easy-to-use mechanisms for integrating Player flows into storybook.

### Installation

There are a few different parts required to integrate with storybook.

Start by installing `@player-ui/storybook`:

```bash
yarn add @player-ui/storybook
```

Next, add `@player-ui/storybook` to the `addons` section in `.storybook/main.js`

```js
module.exports = {
  addons: ["@player-ui/storybook"],
};
```

In `.storybook/preview.js` add the `PlayerDecorator`:

```jsx
import { PlayerDecorator } from "@player-ui/storybook";

export const decorators = [PlayerDecorator];
```

Lastly use the `PlayerStory` component to render a flow:

```jsx
import { PlayerStory } from "@player-ui/storybook";

export const MyStory = <PlayerStory flow={initialFlow} />;
```

The `reactPlayerPlugins` story parameter allows you to add any custom plugins (like asset providers) to a story. This can also be set in the `.storybook/preview.js` file as a global option:

```js
import { ReferenceAssetsPlugin } from "@player-ui/reference-assets-plugin-react";

export const parameters = {
  reactPlayerPlugins: [new ReferenceAssetsPlugin()],
};
```

### Panels

#### Events

The events panel addon shows a timeline of events as the flow is processed. Here you will see logs, render/update metrics, data mutations, and more.

#### Flow

The flow panel addon enables users to view and edit the JSON content in the running Player.

#### Asset Docs

The asset docs panel will show the data-types for the configured Assets.

In order to configure the panel to show specific asset documentation, first include the `assetXLRSources` as a parameter in your `preview.js`:

```ts
import RefXLR from "@player-ui/reference-assets-plugin/dist/xlr/manifest.js";

export const parameters = {
  assetXLRSources: [RefXLR],
};
```

then use the `assetDocs` parameter in each story to set the asset types to render:

```ts
const meta: Meta<typeof Action> = {
  title: "Reference Assets/Action",
  component: Action,
  parameters: {
    assetDocs: ["ActionAsset"],
  },
};
```

#### Reset

The reset button in the toolbar will reset the running Player with the initial content. This is useful for clearing any data or validation state, or for resetting a completed flow.
