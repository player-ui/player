## Reference Assets

The reference asset set, complete with the storybook-plugin integration below is available [here](/storybook-demo)

## Storybook Plugin

The `@player-ui/storybook` package is a storybook addon + wrapper that provides easy-to-use mechanisms for integrating Player flows into storybook.


### Installation

There are a few different parts required to integrate with storybook.

Start by installing `@player-ui/storybook`:

```bash
yarn add @player-ui/storybook
```

Next, add `@player-ui/storybook` to the `addons` section in `.storybook/main.js`

```js
module.exports = {
  addons: [
    '@player-ui/storybook'
  ]
}
```

In `.storybook/preview.js` add the `PlayerDecorator`:

```jsx
import { PlayerDecorator } from '@player-ui/storybook';

export const decorators = [
  PlayerDecorator
];
```

Lastly use the `PlayerStory` component to render a flow:

```jsx
import { PlayerStory } from '@player-ui/storybook';

export const MyStory = (
  <PlayerStory flow={initialFlow} />
)
```

The `reactPlayerPlugins` story parameter allows you to add any custom plugins (like asset providers) to a story. This can also be set in the `.storybook/preview.js` file as a global option: 

```js
import { ReferenceAssetsPlugin } from '@player-ui/reference-assets-plugin-react';

export const parameters = {
  reactPlayerPlugins: [
    new ReferenceAssetsPlugin()
  ],
}
```

### Panels

#### Events

The events panel addon shows a timeline of events as the flow is processed. Here you will see logs, render/update metrics, data mutations, and more.

#### Flow

The flow panel addon enables users to view and edit the JSON content in the running Player.

#### Reset

The reset button in the toolbar will reset the running Player with the initial content. This is useful for clearing any data or validation state, or for resetting a completed flow.
