# CLI

The `CLI` package is a simple way for users to interact with some of the build/validation tooling. As new capabilities are added to the ecosystem, they may be exposed via this cli to use of use for developers. 

## Config

Config files are able to customize the behavior of the CLI commands without requiring args. Behavior specific to execution can leverage `plugins`, which can be composed together using `presets`. Full configs can also be shared using `extensions`.

To resolve a full configuration, the `extension` is taken as the base, the `presets` are applied in order, then local `plugins`.
The format is similar to `eslint`, `babel` and other .rc/json/js based approaches.

Config files are searched using cosmiconfig, which will look for:

- a `player` property in package.json
- a `.playerrc` file in JSON or YAML format
- a `.player.json`, `.playerrc.yaml`, `.playerrc.yml`, `.playerrc.js`, or `.playerrc.cjs` file
- a `player.config.js` or `player.config.cjs` CommonJS module exporting an object

Example:

```js
module.exports = {
  extends: '@my-scope/base',
  plugins: [
    'plugin-npm-package',
    ['some-plugin-with-config', { config: true }],
    {
      // Plugins can also be defined inline
      handler: () => {},
    },
  ],
};
```

Options defined via the CLI arguments will take precedence over the config files (for things that overlap).

## Plugins

Plugins are the way to change runtime behavior of the CLI actions. This includes augmenting the behavior of the DSL compiler, language-service, and more.

# Commands

- [`player dsl compile`](#player-dsl-compile)
Compile Player DSL files into JSON after running TSC compiler against Typescript files

```
USAGE
  $ player dsl compile -i <value> [-c <value>] [-o <value>] [--skip-validation]

FLAGS
  -c, --config=<value>  Path to a specific config file to load.
                        By default, will automatically search for an rc or config file to load
  -i, --input=<value>   (required) An input directory to compile.
                        Any jsx/ts/tsx files will be loaded via babel-require automatically.
  -o, --output=<value>  [default: _out] Output directory to write results to
  --skip-validation     Option to skip validating the generated JSON

DESCRIPTION
  Compile Player DSL files into JSON after running TSC compiler against Typescript files
```

- [`player dsl validate`](#player-dsl-validate)
Runs isolated TSC compiler on authored Player DSL Typescript files.

```
USAGE
  $ player dsl validate [-f <value>] [-c <value>] 

FLAGS
  -c, --config=<value>  Path to a specific config file to load.
                        By default, will automatically search for an rc or config file to load
  -f, --files=<value>...  A list of files or globs to validate

DESCRIPTION
  Runs isolated TSC compiler on authored Player DSL Typescript files.
```

- [`player json validate`](#player-json-validate)
Validate Player JSON content

```
USAGE
  $ player json validate -f <value> [-c <value>]

FLAGS
  -c, --config=<value>    Path to a specific config file to load.
                          By default, will automatically search for an rc or config file to load
  -f, --files=<value>...  (required) A list of files or globs to validate

DESCRIPTION
  Validate Player JSON content
```

- [`player dependency-versions check`](#player-dependency-versions-check)
Checks for `@player-ui/@player-tools` dependency version mismatches and issues warnings/solutions accordingly

```
USAGE
  $ player dependency-versions check [-c <value>] [-v] [-p] [-i <value>]
FLAGS
  -c, --config=<value>     Path to a specific config file to load.
                           By default, will automatically search for an rc or config file to load
  -i, --ignore=<value>...  Ignore the specified pattern(s) when outputting results. Note multiple patterns can be passed
  -p, --path               Outputs full path to dependency
  -v, --verbose            Give verbose description
DESCRIPTION
  Checks for `@player-ui/@player-tools` dependency version mismatches and issues warnings/solutions accordingly
  Consider the following:
  - The interpretation of TOP-LEVEL and NESTED dependencies is as follows:
  a. TOP-LEVEL dependencies only have one 'node_modules' in their path
  b. NESTED dependencies have more than one 'node_modules' in their path
  - `@player-ui/@player-tools` dependencies are fetched not only from inside the 'node_modules' at the top of the repository in which it is run but also from 'node_modules' in sub-directories.
  For example, if you have some 'node_modules' inside of a 'packages' folder that contains `@player-ui/@player-tools` dependencies, then these will also be fetched.
  The display of such dependencies also depends on the first bullet point.
