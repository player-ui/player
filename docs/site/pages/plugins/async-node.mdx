# Async Node Plugin

The AsyncNode Plugin is used to enable streaming additional content into a flow that has already been loaded and rendered.    
A common use case for this plugin is conversational UI, as the users input more dialogue, new content must be streamed into Player in order to keep the UI up to date.

The pillar that makes this possible is the concept of an `AsyncNode`. An `AsyncNode` is any tree node with the property `async: true`, it represents a placeholder node that will be replaced by a concrete node in the future.

In the example below, node with the id "some-async-node" will not be rendered on first render, but will be replaced with a UI asset node at a later time:

```json
{
  "id": "flow-1",
    "views": [
      {
        "id": 'action',
        "actions": [
          {
            "id": "some-async-node",
            "async": true,
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  ...
}
```

The `AsyncNodePlugin` exposes an `onAsyncNode` hook on all platforms. The `onAsyncNode` hook will be invoked with the current node when the plugin is available and an `AsyncNode` is detected during the resolve process. The node used to call the hook with could contain metadata according to content spec.

User should tap into the `onAsyncNode` hook to examine the node's metadata before making a decision on what to replace the async node with. The return could be a single asset node or an array of asset nodes.


### Continuous Streaming

In order to keep streaming in new content, there must be at least 1 or more `AsyncNode`s in the view tree at all times.    
This means there must be a constant renewal of new `AsyncNode`s after the previous ones are resolved by the user.

## Usage

The AsyncNodePlugin itself accepts a list of plugins and should take the AsyncNodePluginPlugin to be passed in. The AsyncNodePluginPlugin also comes from the `'@player-ui/async-node-plugin'` and contains the resolver and parser functionality

<PlatformTabs>
  <core>

Add the plugin to Player:

```js
import { Player } from '@player-ui/player';
import { AsyncNodePlugin, AsyncNodePluginPlugin } from '@player-ui/async-node-plugin';

const asyncNodePlugin = new AsyncNodePlugin({
    plugins: [new AsyncNodePluginPlugin()],
});

// Configuring async node behaviour
asyncNodePlugin.hooks.onAsyncNode.tap('handleAsync', async (node: Node.Node) => {
  ...
  // Determine what to return to be parsed into a concrete UI asset
});

const player = new Player({
  plugins: [
    asyncNodePlugin
  ]
})
```
  </core>
  <react>

The `react` version of the AsyncNodePlugin is identical to using the core plugin. Refer to core usage for handler configuration:

```js
import { ReactPlayer } from '@player-ui/react';
import { AsyncNodePlugin, AsyncNodePluginPlugin } from '@player-ui/async-node-plugin';

const asyncNodePlugin = new AsyncNodePlugin({
    plugins: [new AsyncNodePluginPlugin()],
});

const player = new ReactPlayer({
  plugins: [
    asyncNodePlugin
  ]
})
```

  </react>
  <ios>

### CocoaPods

Add the subspec to your `Podfile`

```ruby
pod 'PlayerUI/AsyncNodePlugin'
```

### Swift Usage

In integration code

```swift
var body: some View {
    SwiftUIPlayer(
        flow: flow,
        plugins: [
          AsyncNodePlugin(plugins: [AsyncNodePluginPlugin()]) { node in
              // Determine what to return either using the singleNode or multiNode case
              // Then JSON can be provided using the concrete case, see below for using the encodable case
              return .singleNode(.concrete(jsContext?.evaluateScript("""
                  ({"asset": {"id": "text", "type": "text", "value":"new node from the hook"}})
                  """) ?? JSValue()))

              // OR
              return .multiNode([
                .concrete(jsContext?.evaluateScript("""
                  ({"asset": {"id": "text", "type": "text", "value":"1st value in the multinode"}})
                  """) ?? JSValue()),
                .concrete(jsContext?.evaluateScript("""
                  ({"asset": {"id": "async-node-2", "async": "true" }})
                  """) ?? JSValue())
              ])

          }
        ],
        result: $resultBinding
    )
}
```

The plugin also provides a default asset placeholder struct that is encodable, instead of passing in the JSON string users can use
`AssetPlaceholderNode` which includes an `asset` key that takes any user defined Encodable struct as the value. Assuming the following encodable struct is defined:

```swift
struct PlaceholderNode: Codable, Equatable, AssetData {
    public var id: String
    public var type: String
    var value: String?

    public init(id: String, type: String, value: String? = nil) {
        self.id = id
        self.type = type
        self.value = value
    }
}
```

Instead of using the JSON string above, the following can be used:

```swift
return .singleNode(.encodable(PlaceholderNode(id: "text", type: "text", value: "new node from the hook")))

// OR

return .multiNode([
    ReplacementNode.encodable(PlaceholderNode(id: "text", type: "text", value: "1st value in the multinode")),
    ReplacementNode.encodable(AsyncNode(id: "id"))])
```

Note: the AsyncNode struct is already defined in the plugin with the `async` property defaulted to true so only `id` needs to be passed in

As a convenience to the user, the AsyncNodePlugin just takes a callback which has the content to be returned, this is provided to the plugin which calls the the `onAsyncNode` hook tap method

  <android>

In build.gradle
```kotlin
implementation "com.intuit.playerui.plugins:async-node:$PLAYER_VERSION"
```

In integration code
```kotlin
import com.intuit.playerui.plugins.asyncnode.AsyncNodePlugin

val asyncNodePlugin = AsyncNodePlugin(plugins: [AsyncNodePluginPlugin()])

// Configuring async node behaviour
asyncNodePlugin.hooks.onAsyncNode.tap("handleAsync") { hookContext, node ->
    ...
    // Determine what to return in the form of a list of maps representing UI asset to be parsed
    // e.g.
    // listOf(
    //  mapOf(
    //    "asset" to mapOf(
    //      "id" to "asset-1",
    //      "type" to "text",
    //      "value" to "new asset!"
    //    )
    //  )
    // )
}
