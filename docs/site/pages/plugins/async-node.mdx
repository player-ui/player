# Async Node Plugin

The AsyncNode Plugin is used to enable streaming additional content into a flow that has already been loaded and rendered.    
A common use case for this plugin is conversational UI, as the users input more dialogue, new content must be streamed into Player in order to keep the UI up to date.

The pillar that makes this possible is the concept of an `AsyncNode`. An `AsyncNode` is any node with the property `async: true`, it represents a placeholder node that will be replaced by a concrete node in the future.

In the example below, node with the id "some-async-node" will not be rendered on first render, but will be replaced with a concrete asset node at a later time:

```json
{
  "id": "flow-1",
    "views": [
      {
        "id": 'action',
        "actions": [
          {
            "id": "some-async-node",
            "async": true,
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  ...
}
```

The `AsyncNodePlugin` exposes an `onAsyncNode` hook on all platforms. The `onAsyncNode` hook will be invoked with the current node when the plugin is available and an `AsyncNode` is detected during the resolve process. The node used to call the hook with could contain metadata according to content spec.

User should tap into the `onAsyncNode` hook to examine the node's metadata before making a decision on what to replace the async node with. The return could be a single node or an array of nodes.


### Continuous Streaming

In order to keep streaming in new content, there must be at least 1 or more `AsyncNode`s in the view tree at all times.    
This means there must be a constant renewal of new `AsyncNode`s after the previous ones are resolved by the user.

## Usage

<PlatformTabs>
  <core>

Add the plugin to Player:

```js
import { Player } from '@player-ui/player';
import { AsyncNodePlugin } from '@player-ui/async-node-plugin';

const asyncNodePlugin = new AsyncNodePlugin();

// Configuring async node behaviour
asyncNodePlugin.hooks.onAsyncNode.tap('handleAsync', async (node: Node.Node) => {
  ...
  // Determine what to return to be parsed into a concrete node
});

const player = new Player({
  plugins: [
    asyncNodePlugin
  ]
})
```
  </core>
  <react>

The `react` version of the AsyncNodePlugin is identical to using the core plugin. Refer to core usage for handler configuration:

```js
import { ReactPlayer } from '@player-ui/react';
import { MetricsPlugin } from '@player-ui/async-node-plugin';

const asyncNodePlugin = new AsyncNodePlugin();

const player = new ReactPlayer({
  plugins: [
    asyncNodePlugin
  ]
})
```

  </react>
  <ios>

  </ios>
  <android>

In build.gradle
```kotlin
implementation "com.intuit.player.plugins:async-node:$JVM_PLAYER_VERSION"
```

In integration code
```kotlin
import com.intuit.player.plugins.asyncnode.AsyncNodePlugin

val asyncNodePlugin = AsyncNodePlugin()

// Configuring async node behaviour
asyncNodePlugin.hooks.onAsyncNode.tap("handleAsync") { hookContext, node ->
    ...
    // Determine what to return in the form of a list of maps representing nodes that can be parsed
    // e.g.
    // listOf(
    //  mapOf(
    //    "asset" to mapOf(
    //      "id" to "asset-1",
    //      "type" to "text",
    //      "value" to "new asset!"
    //    )
    //  )
    // )
}

AndroidPlayer(asyncNodePlugin)
```
  </android>
