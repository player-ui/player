# Partial Match Plugin

This plugin enables users to map matches of assets to any arbitrary value in a partial-match-registry. 
For each asset in a resolved view, the matches will be computed. 


## Usage

<PlatformTabs>
  <core>

Create a registry and add matches:

```ts
import { Registry } from '@player-ui/partial-match-registry';

const registry = new Registry([
  [{ type: 'action' }, 'ABC']
])
```

Add the registy to a plugin:

```ts
import { Player } from '@player-ui/player';
import { PartialMatchFingerprintPlugin } from '@player-ui/partial-match-fingerprint-plugin';

const matchPlugin = new PartialMatchFingerprintPlugin(registry);

const player = new Player({
  plugins: [matchPlugin]
})
```

Query the plugin for matches:

```ts
const value = matchPlugin.get('asset-id') // 'ABC'
```
  </core>
  <ios>

This plugin is used by `BaseAssetRegistry` to handle matching resolved asset nodes with their native implementation, to decode for rendering. It is unlikely to be needed to be used directly in iOS use cases.

### CocoaPods
Add the subspec to your `Podfile`

```ruby
pod 'PlayerUI'
```

### Swift Usage
```swift
let plugin = PartialMatchFingerprintPlugin()

// iOS usage links the array position of a registered asset to its requested match object
// The JavaScript part of this plugin will populate matches when the view is resolving
plugin.register(match: ["type": "text"], index: 1)

// get the index for the asset with matching ID if it was resolved in the core plugin
plugin.get(assetId: "test")
```
  </ios>
