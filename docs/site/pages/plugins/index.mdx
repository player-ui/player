# Plugins

Plugins are one of the main ways to customize Player to suite individual use-cases. 
Internally they allow access to many of the core sub-systems, which can add features, configuration, or custom behaviors.

The scope of what a plugin is capable of is pretty broad, but are typically broken down into smaller reusable modules. Some are more end-user focused ([Common Expression Plugin](../plugins/common-expressions) and [Common Types Plugin](../plugins/common-types)) while others are more relavant for other plugin developers ([Expression Plugin](../plugins/expression) and [Types Provider Plugin](../plugins/types-provider))
