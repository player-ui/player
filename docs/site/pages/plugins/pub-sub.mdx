# PubSub Plugin

The PubSub plugin adds a publish/subscribe interface between the host app and Player's content. 

## Usage

<PlatformTabs>
  <core>

Add the plugin to Player:

```ts
import { Player } from '@player-ui/player';
import { PubSubPlugin } from '@player-ui/pub-sub-plugin';

const pubsub = new PubSubPlugin();

const token = pubsub.subscribe('some-event', () => {
  // Callback
});

const player = new Player({
  plugins: [pubsub]
})
```

To unsubscribe:

```ts
pubsub.unsubscribe(token);
```

  </core>
  <ios>

If your content uses the `@[ publish() ]@` expression for actions, you can subscribe to these events by using the `PubSubPlugin`.

### CocoaPods
Add the subspec to your `Podfile`

```ruby
pod 'PlayerUI/PubSubPlugin'
```

### Swift Usage
```swift
let eventHandler: (String, AnyType?) -> Void = { (eventName, eventData) in
  // Handle event
}
let plugin = PubSubPlugin([("eventName", eventHandler)])
```

If your content uses a different name for publishing (such as `publishEvent`) you can customize the expression name that the plugin uses:

```swift
let plugin = PubSubPlugin([("eventName", eventHandler)], options: PubSubPluginOptions(expressionName: "publishEvent"))
```

Then, just include it in your `plugins` to a Player instance:
```swift
var body: some View {
  SwiftUIPlayer(
    flow: flow,
    plugins: [
      plugin
    ],
    result: $resultBinding
  )
}
```

_Note: AnyType is a custom enum type to handle the arbitrary types that can be received from these events, as the data is set in your Player Content, ensure that it matches either String, [String], or [String: String]._

  </ios>
  <android>

The `PubSubPlugin` provides support for handling the publish expressions in Player content at the app level. The PubSubPlugin is included by default in the Android Player, so configuring events subscriptions can be done on Player using the provided extension methods.

```json
{
  "id": "action",
  "type": "action",
  "exp": "@[ publish('some-event', {{foo.bar}}) ]@"
}
```
```kotlin
val player = AndroidPlayer(context)

// extension method for subscribing to some event
val token = player.subscribe("some-event") { name: String, data: Any? ->
    // name of event can be used for logging
    // data can be any structure passed by the content, if any
    // handle event
}

// extension method for removing a specific event subscription 
player.unsubscribe(token)
```

  </android>
</PlatformTabs>

## Publish Expression

To trigger an event to be published, use the `publish()` expression in Player's content: 

```json
{
  "asset": {
    "id": "sample",
    "type": "action",
    "exp": "@[ publish('some-event', 'some optional data') ]@""
  }
}
```
