# Meta Plugin

The Meta Plugin is an easy way to combine multiple _other_ plugins into 1 group. It is often used when sharing a set of plugins across platforms (each platform registering 1 common set of _core_ plugins).

# Usage

<PlatformTabs>
  <core>

Create a grouping of other plugins:

```js
import { MetaPlugin } from '@player-ui/meta-plugin';

const pluginGroup = new MetaPlugin([
  new Plugin1(),
  new Plugin2()
]);
```

Add the plugin to Player:

```js
import { Player } from '@player-ui/player';

const player = new Player({
  plugins: [pluginGroup],
});
```

You can share `pluginGroup` with others as an easy way to group multiple plugin features together.

  </core>
</PlatformTabs>
