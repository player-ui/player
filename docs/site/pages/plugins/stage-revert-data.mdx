# Stage Revert Data Plugin

This plugin enables users to temporarily stage data changes before committing to the actual data model

A `stageData` property flag inside of the `view properties` must be added on the desired view configs.

```json
{
  "VIEW_1": {
    "state_type": "VIEW",
    "ref": "view-1",
    "attributes": {
      "stageData": true,
      "commitTransitions": ["VIEW_2"]
    },
    "transitions": {
      "next": "VIEW_2",
      "*": "ACTION_1"
    }
  }
}
```

It also should include a list of acceptable `commitTransitions` valid `VIEW` name for the data to be committed when the transition occurs, A not included commit transition would trigger the staged data to be cleared. An acceptable transition will commit the data into the `data model`. e.g. as per the previous example transitioning to `VIEW_2` will trigger the staged data to get committed in the model, since the `next` transition property is pointing to it and is listed on the `commitTransitions` array parameter, otherwise it would get thrown away.

## Example

<PlatformTabs>
  <core>

Simply add the plugin to the config when constructing a player instance.

```javascript
import StageRevertPlugin from '@player/stage-revert-data';

const player = new Player({
  plugins: [new StageRevertPlugin()],
});
```

  </core>
  <ios>

### CocoaPods
Add the subspec to your `Podfile`

```ruby
pod 'PlayerUI/StageRevertDataPlugin'
```

### Swift Usage
This plugin takes no parameters, and the configuration comes from content, it can just be added to the plugin array:
```swift
var body: some View {
  SwiftUIPlayer(
    flow: flow,
    plugins: [
      StageRevertDataPlugin()
    ],
    result: $resultBinding
  )
}
```
  </ios>
