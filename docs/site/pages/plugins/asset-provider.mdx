# Asset Provider

The Asset Provider Plugin enables users to easily register UI components to render their assets. It's used internally by the [Reference Assets](../assets/reference). The matches follow the same rules as asset transforms (more specific matches take priority).

### Usage

<PlatformTabs>
  <react>

Install the plugin:

```bash
yarn add @player-ui/asset-provider-plugin-react
```

Create an instance, and add it to your Player instance. 
The API is similar to the JavaScript `Map`, and takes a list of `[match, Component]` tuples.

```tsx
import { ReactPlayer } from '@player-ui/react';
import { AssetProviderPlugin } from '@player-ui/asset-provider-plugin-react';

const player = new ReactPlayer({
  plugins: [
    new AssetProviderPlugin([
      ['custom-asset', () => <div>Hello World!</div>],
      [{ type: 'custom', key: 'asset' }, () => <div>Other Custom Asset</div>],
    ])
  ]
})
```

This will register a match on `{ type: 'custom-asset' }` and `{ type: 'custom', key: 'asset' }` in the view to use your React components.

  </react>
</PlatformTabs>
