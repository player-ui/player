# Reference Assets

The assets in this section are an example implementation of an Asset Library for Player.
Each of the Asset components follows the same basic pattern:

| Export                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<Name>Asset`            | Typescript type interface representing the authored player content                                                                                                                                            |
| `Transformed<Name>Asset` | (optional) - A Typescript interface representing the _transformed_ version of the asset interface. This extends the base interface and includes any state/properties added by the associated transform.       |
| `transform`              | (optional) - A function (used by the `AssetTransformPlugin`) to adopt Player's current state with the component state. If no `transfrom` is present, the component state is the same as the authored content. |
| `Component`              | React component rendering of the given asset. The props are the _transformed_ type (if supplied) or the _authored_ type.                                                                                      |

## Usage

To import and use these Assets in your App, simply import the `plugin` and attach it to Player:

```tsx
import { useReactPlayer, ReactPlayerPlugin } from "@player-ui/react";
import ReferenceAssetsPlugin from "@player-ui/reference-assets/plugin-react";

const plugins: Array<ReactPlayerPlugin> = [new ReferenceAssetsPlugin()];

export const App = () => {
  // Create Player with our plugins
  const { reactPlayer } = useReactPlayer({ plugins });

  // Start the flow.

  React.useEffect(() => {
    reactPlayer.start(/** Insert your player content */);
  }, []);

  // Render Player
  return <ReactPlayer.Component />;
};
```
